A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
REMEMBER WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w28823")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w28823")' onclick='show("w28823")' id='b28823'>Page 1</span><br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w28824")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w28824")' onclick='show("w28824")' id='b28824'></span><br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL begins flipping through the pages of his notebook)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?  <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />

WILL<br />

SKIP<br />
Slobbers? What was he doing?<br />

JACK<br />
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted. <br />

Hey now, there's no need to get all huffy...it's not my fault your sister's bangin'!<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sarcastic) A piece of paper.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Just read!<br />
<br />

(reading) "Come one, come all to the Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." What!? FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Keep reading!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." <br />

Wow, you read that really well! You didn't stutter or anything.<br />
<br />

Shut up! (to WILL) What the hell is this? <br />

WILL<br />
This,my friend, is inspiration.   <br />

Oh Jesus.... (i.e. "here we go again...")<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please. <br />
<br />
(ANDY obliges, easily amused by his own improvised drum roll. His drum roll slows as the names start to land) <br />
<br />
<br />
Matt Hoffman, Chris Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - <br />

JACK<br />
No shit!? <br />

Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle. You see that box?<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL points to a small weather box situated near the players bench)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yup.<br />

JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />

WILL<br />
Skip?<br />

Uh-huh. Box. Got it.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That box contains something truly magical.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Is it Christmas?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No. Better. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. <br />
<br />

(amazed. To WILL) We're gonna soak the bastards!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
 Why?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we were made fun of. For every time we were walked over or treated like shit. This is karma at its finest boys! <br />

ANDY<br />
Blown! My mind is officially blown.<br />

He also borrowed my pen during Calculus and never gave it back. I'll never forget that. <br />

How many?(Will runs over to the bleachers and stands on the first row of seats) Who sat here? Huh? (Will runs back to the third row and stands) Who sat here? (The guys laugh. But WILL is driven.) No really! (beat) Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! (Points to where Andy is sitting)<br />

(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." <br />

NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />

IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />

THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />

IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />

GLORY DAYS<br />
A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
REMEMBER WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b28823")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b28823")' onclick='show("b28823")' id='w28823'></span>SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />

        <br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL begins flipping through the pages of his notebook)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
 <br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

Hey now, there's no need to get all huffy...it's not my fault your sister's bangin'! <br />

All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY!<br />

ANDY<br />
(reading)"Come one, come all to the Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." What!? FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Keep reading!<br />

ANDY<br />
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." <br />

Wow, you read that really well! You didn't stutter or anything.<br />

WILL<br />
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please?<br />

That box contains something truly magical.<br />

Is it Christmas?<br />

No. Better. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. <br />

 Why?<br />

Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we were made fun of. For every time we were walked over or treated like shit. This is karma at its finest boys! <br />

Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.<br />

To EAT!? That's an operation. Where'd you take her? Arby's? No wait! No no wait I got it - it's coming to me - where would you take her so no one would see you AND your jew ass could feed her for cheap.... Denny's!<br />

ANDY<br />
(laughing hysterically) Yes!!! I knew it! What'd she get? I have to know. <br />

IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />

The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />

JACK<br />
Kissed?<br />

Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />

JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />

<br />
Why not?<br />

I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />

You just did. Something else? <br />

Yea. How long have you known? <br />

About what? <br />

<br />
You know. I mean, was it something that you've always known or</span>...<br />

(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />

<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b29016")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b29016")' onclick='show("b29016")' id='w29016'></span>kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, long beat)<br />
<br />
    Does <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b29017")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b29017")' onclick='show("b29017")' id='w29017'>it</span> bother you?<br />

No, of course not. <br />

Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
 <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b29020")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b29020")' onclick='show("b29020")' id='w29020'>65</span><br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b29021")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b29021")' onclick='show("b29021")' id='w29021'>something</span>. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b29022")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b29022")' onclick='show("b29022")' id='w29022'></span>sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b29023")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b29023")' onclick='show("b29023")' id='w29023'></span>   <br />
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />

        <br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />

HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />

<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b29082")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b29082")' onclick='show("b29082")' id='w29082'></span>OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />

WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />
