MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
REMEMBER WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />

<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
2<br />
        <br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />

SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />

<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />

BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />

Don't start man -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
What!? I'm genuinely interested!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(suspicious) She's fine. <br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me? <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm gonna punch you in the face - <br />

    ANDY<br />
She's twelve years old!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Hey, whatever floats your boat, right? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to JACK)My sister is not allowed to float anyone's boat!  <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Aww, you're no fun.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
But your sister is! <br />
<br />
SKIP and JACK<br />
OHHHHHHH!!(raspberry<br />

ANDY<br />
(grabbing at SKIP and JACK)Come here! <br />
    <br />
(ANDY chases SKIP and JACK around the field) <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What? Take it as a compliment. You've got good genes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I swear to God-<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY!<br />
    <br />
(WILL throws his arms around ANDY to hold him back. Andy continues to struggle) <br />
<br />
<br />
(to ANDY)Chill! Look, we've got important business to take care of - <br />
<br />
    (ANDY stops struggling and WILL releases him.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
I got you later! <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Oh yeah?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, you little twinkie!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 (scolding) Okay, enough! Here. Read.<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL hands ANDY a newspaper clipping)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sarcastic) A piece of paper.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Just read!<br />
<br />
(ANDY takes a look at the paper. Clears his throat and reads)<br />
 10<br />
        <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(reading)"Come one, come all to the Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." What!? FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Keep reading!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Wow, you read that really well! You didn't stutter or anything.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Shut up! (to WILL) What the hell is this? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This,my friend, is inspiration. <br />
<br />
<br />
    (WILL takes the paper from ANDY and walks back towards the player's bench)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh Jesus.... (i.e. "here we go again...")<br />
<br />
(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox)<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please?<br />
<br />
(ANDY obliges, easily amused by his own improvised drum roll. His drum roll slows as the names start to land) <br />
<br />
Matt Hoffman, Chris Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
No shit!? <br />
 11<br />
        <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle. You see that box</span>?<br />

Uh-huh. Box. Got it.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That box contains something truly magical.<br />

JACK<br />
Is it Christmas?<br />

WILL<br />
No. Better.

ANDY<br />
(amazed. To WILL) We're gonna soak the bastards!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Why?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we were made fun of. For every time we were walked over or treated like shit. This is karma at its finest boys! <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Blown! My mind is officially blown. <br />

WILL<br />
We've waited for this moment for five years and tomorrow it's on. All we have to do is reset the timer.<br />

WILL<br />
(to SKIP, referencing ANDY) Exactly why I didn't want to tell you!<br />

ANDY<br />
You don't remember PAT!? Sophomore last year, redhead? She's the janitor's niece. Kinda ... thick?<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
What!?<br />

WILL<br />
Don't call her thick!<br />

ANDY<br />
I'm creating a visual. <br />

JACK<br />
You did just call her Fat Pat.<br />

Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.<br />

SKIP<br />
Why'd she give it to you?<br />

WILL<br />
(a slight hesitation) Cause she was being nice.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(joking) Yeah right! What'd you do, take her out on a date?<br />

No I - No. (pause) It wasn't a date. <br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
(hardly controlling himself) Then what was it?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We just went out to eat.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
To EAT!? That's an operation. Where'd you take her? Arby's? No wait! No no wait I got it - it's coming to me - where would you take her so no one would see you AND your jew ass could feed her for cheap.... Denny's!<br />
<br />
(WILL remains silent.)<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(laughing hysterically) Yes!!! I knew it! What'd she get? I have to know. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, really?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
A steak, or three? Some cheeseburgers? Maybe a nice little Chocolate Brownie Fudge Delight with some extra fixins?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Sprinkles!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh we are beyond sprinkles my friend! You KNOW that girl can throw down! We're talking marshmallows, butter scotch, peanuts, candy corn, pop corn... maybe some real corn -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Ewww.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Hot fudge, a couple bananas for potassium -<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 You're a real jerk, you know that? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Ah come on man. I'm just playing! Look, I'm seriously proud of you! She's a catch.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
She's not a catch and you know it!<br />

ANDY<br />
Why?<br />

WILL<br />
Cause she's...<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
...Fat? That's fucked up Will.<br />

(JACK laughs at this)<br />
WILL<br />
 I didn't say that. You're the one calling her fat!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
All I'm saying is she's a sure thing. (putting his arm around WILL) And Will, buddy, you need to start taking advantage of these opportunities. Cause let's be honest, you didn't really get any this year.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(pushing ANDY away) Just cuz I didn't want any of the diseased skanks that you and your frat brothers hooked up with doesn't mean I didn't get any.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What are you talking about? Those girls were prime real estate!<br />

Woah, woah, woah. I'm sorry. You joined a frat? <br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
You're lame!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Isn't that kinda like buying your friends? <br />

Yeah, but Ghandi didn't live in an age of iPods and On Demand. People would rather sit on their asses and wait for someone else to do what they'd rather not do themselves, just because they can. My roommate isn't any different. So why should I be?<br />

BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WHO USED TO LOVE EACH OTHER, CUZ WHO CARES<br />
THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD WE'RE IN WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT HERE<br />

You should be proud. You skipped Kindergarten! That means you're smarter than us.<br />

WILL<br />
(into the phone) Don't worry about it. No no it's okay. <br />

ANDY<br />
What did she say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Thanks anyway. (beat)  Umm... yeah I'm actually busy Thursday night too so.... Uh-huh. Yeah that's a bad night too. Remember- broken bones. I got broken bones. Okay well gotta run, but I'll talk to you later. Okay. Great! Bye. (hangs up the phone) Jesus.<br />

That girl does not give up.<br />

No, what's up with the key!?<br />

WILL<br />
Well... she says it's in the building.  <br />

ANDY<br />
What!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently it may be in the maintenance closet. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
So what did she give us?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
She doesn't know, but now she's pretty sure it's in there. <br />

ANDY<br />
(sarcastic) Well that's great, we probably have his car keys. What are we supposed to do now?<br />

You think?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
How?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
There's that window in the gym. I used to sneak out of it during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />

Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />

Probably.<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />

Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />

JACK<br />
No. There isn't. <br />

WILL<br />
What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
Kissed?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
About what? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You know. I mean, was it something that you've always known or...<br />
 64<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, long beat)<br />
<br />
    Does it bother you?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question, you know?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
 65<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or something. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN   <br />
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
 66<br />
        <br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />

IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />

WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />

WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />

JACK AND WILL<br />
<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />

WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 67<br />
        <br />

WILL<br />
Jack - <br />

ANDY<br />
What?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
That you couldn't deal with it. That you've been sitting here all night and you didn't want to say anything. Why not, why wouldn't you just talk to me?<br />
<br />

ANDY<br />

He was being a good friend, Andy. I think I have the right to know that.<br />

WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />

THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />

IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />

THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />

I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />

<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />

AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />

I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />

"May I use your bathroom?"<br />

THAT IT MAKES YOU GO INSANE<br />

<br />
WILL and ANDY<br />

SKIP<br />
Will, this whole thing is really childish.<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You didn't think that last year.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
That prank was stupid too. The next day they printed out new copies of the diplomas.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but they didn't have them for the ceremony.<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
So? Those assholes still graduated. The world didn't spin off its axis. It was a minor inconvenience at best.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Plus we could've been expelled for that.<br />

WILL<br />
But we weren't! Come on, what happened to you guys? You used to love shit like this!<br />

WILL<br />
Come on guys. It's only the sprinklers.<br />

<br />
ALL<br />
(WILL starts as the others join in gradually)<br />
WE CAN TRY <br />
TO BE ASS BACKWARDS AND RISE ABOVE THE REST <br />
AND BE ASS BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF BEING THE BEST <br />
ASS BACKWARDS IS SEEING OUR LIVES FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES <br />
EACH OTHER'S EYES<br />
<br />
 <br />
BEING ASS BACKWARDS <br />
AND LEARNING FROM OUR FRIENDS THAT BEING ASS BACKWARDS <br />
MEANS FRIENDSHIP NEVER ENDS <br />

<br />
WILL<br />
So?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Alright. Fine, let's do it.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Great!<br />
 <br />
<br />
(They all run over to the box)<br />
 <br />
(looking into the box) Let's see. Tomorrow is....?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Thursday.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Right. Okay. It's set to go off at... 1:30 tonight.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Graduation starts at 2:00 tomorrow.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
So we'll set it for 2:30! Sound good?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Works for me.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
2:30 it is. (Starts punching in numbers) Hour...2.... (Pause) Hour...2.  Shit!!<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
What?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
It's got a password.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
No it doesn't!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Yes, Andy, it clearly does.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Where?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
There, where it says "password."<br />
 <br />
(ANDY stares at the screen. Silence)<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't have it, do you?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I didn't fucking know there was one! (beat) Why don't you just type in Stallions or something?<br />
 <br />
(ANDY reaches into the box)<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No! (smacks ANDY's hand away) It's not going to be that simple. They're not idiots. For starters, the pad doesn't even have letters. It's just digits.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Well let's start typing in numbers.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
That's dumb.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
You've got a better idea?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Look, why don't we just go over to Jack's house and watch a movie?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
No -<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oooo... We can watch Channel 85!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I'd rather not spend my evening watching scrambled porn. Look, we can figure this out. We've got the whole night.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
The whole night!?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah! That's what we agreed on.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
What is your problem?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I agree with Skip. Numbers and.... I don't think we're gonna be able to figure this out tonight. Let's just go to Jack's.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I'm glad everyone's inviting themselves over to my house.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Besides I'm supposed to meet up with Beth later.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No way!!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Excuse me?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You can screw around with Beth or anybody else you want the rest of the summer. Tonight is about us.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
But...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(resigned) No - this is more important.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No, Andy. I said no!!<br />
 <br />

 <br />
Tell her you can't make it.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
She's gonna be pissed. I made plans with her like a week ago.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah? Well we've been planning this for a month... so call her, deal with it and let's start having a fucking good time!<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
(taken aback. sotto voce) Yes sir...<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Well, what am I supposed to say?<br />
 <br />
WILL</span><br />
I don't care. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b22848")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b22848")' onclick='show("b22848")' id='w22848'>Say you have more important things to do.

 <br />
ANDY<br />
Fine. But maybe you should</span> call her.<br />

WILL<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b22849")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b22849")' onclick='show("b22849")' id='w22849'>I will if you want!<br />

 <br />
ANDY<br />
Screw you!<br />

<br />
(WILL starts to call Chelsea)<br />
<br />
No. I'll do it!<br />
 <br />
(ANDY</span> takes <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b22850")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b22850")' onclick='show("b22850")' id='w22850'>the phone away from WILL, moves upstage)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Idiot.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
(to WILL) So what do you wanna do?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Just let me think.<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
The password has to be written down somewhere, right?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe, but how would we get that?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Well, this is the master key to the building, isn't it?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
So it'll get us into the maintenance closet. And I bet you twenty bucks the password's in there. (beat) Look, it has to be written down. Those guys can't even count to 10, how are they gonna remember a password? I mean it's worth trying! We're running</span> out <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b22851")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b22851")' onclick='show("b22851")' id='w22851'>of ideas.<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(upstage, still talking on the phone) I know. It was terrible. The whole thing just blew up. It was probably a faulty engine- I don't know. Yeah I'm alive. I</span> just broke a few bones. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b22852")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b22852")' onclick='show("b22852")' id='w22852'>Alright listen, I gotta run - but I'll call you tomorrow. Bye babe.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY turns off his phone and crosses downstage to the guys.)<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
All right! So what's the plan?<br />
<br />
 <br />
(SKIP</span> just <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b22853")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b22853")' onclick='show("b22853")' id='w22853'>shakes his head at ANDY)<br />
<br />
What?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
(to WILL) Here</span>, give me <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b22854")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b22854")' onclick='show("b22854")' id='w22854'>the keys. I'll go see what I can find. Twenty bucks.<br />
 <br />
<br />
(WILL gives the keys to SKIP. SKIP exits.)<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Where's he going?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
To see if he can find the password.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Good idea. (beat) Hey, I almost forgot. Do either of you want a beer? It's not the best stuff, but it's all I could find.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY runs over to the bleachers. He pulls a couple bottles out of his bag.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to ANDY) What kind did you get?<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Blankson's Brew.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Did you steal those from your Dad's fridge?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yup.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
That's sad.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(to JACK) You want one?<br />

I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO <br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES <br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS <br />

I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS <br />

AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME <br />

Sure, but you don't know everything.<br />

Okay fine, but I feel like I know something about you. I don't feel like I know anything about Andy. It's like he's a completely different person. Like something got added on or taken away. That's not the same kid I grew up with.<br />

Look, this is gonna work itself out. I don't think he meant to say the things he did. Just give him some time to cool off, then you two can talk. He'll come around.<br />

So you dropped everything and just... left?<br />

JACK<br />
No, it's okay.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Andy?<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) It's cool.<br />
 <br />
SKIP</span><br />
We got <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b23077")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b23077")' onclick='show("b23077")' id='w23077'>it. Let's go!<br />
 <br />
(SKIP and WILL exit. ANDY and JACK are left alone. There is a long silence. ANDY takes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. JACK stares at him. ANDY offers one to JACK)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No... thanks.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY lights a cigarette.)<br />
<br />
When did you start that?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
A couple months ago.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Why?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
It's relaxing.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
That's dumb.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Thanks.<br />
 <br />
(JACK just stares at ANDY. ANDY feels the stare, and puts out the cigarette. He takes a big, deep swig of his beer, almost finishing it. JACK picks up the copy of Playboy that has been lying on the ground. He begins flipping through pages. He opens it up to the centerfold and examines it.)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Wow. She's hot.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY stares at him. Silence.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't you think?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
She's all right.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
She's better then all right, I think. (He examines the picture further) Except for this.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Look at that bush. It's like an untouched forest down there! I can't deal with that. You gotta do a little upkeep. You know, trim away some of the hedge...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Come on.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I know you don't want to talk about that.<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK closes the magazine and tosses it back on the ground. Another long, awkward silence. ANDY opens his duffle bag and pulls out two bottles of beer.)<br />
<br />
You want one of these?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sighs) Sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
(ANDY hands a bottle to JACK. They both take a couple of sips. JACK winces at the taste.)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Remember when we used to steal liquor from Will's Dad's cabinet?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(ANDY cracks a smile) Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'll never forget that time we got caught. Mr. Henry's face will forever be etched in my mind. I'll never forget it, I thought Will was gonna get strangled.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I got in so much trouble for that too. I was grounded for like a month.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You were always grounded! You must have spent half of middle school in your room.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I know! And I did the same shit you guys did. Like when we stole that sign from the Presbyterian Church on Marengo.<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
(laughing) "God Answers Knee Mail."<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah! My mom took my car away. Wouldn't let me go out for three weeks. You guys weren't even punished!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I had to spend winter break doing inventory at my dad's store.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Whoop-de-fucking-do! I had to baby sit Samantha every day!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
She's so cute</span> though.<br />
 <br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b23078")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b23078")' onclick='show("b23078")' id='w23078'>ANDY<br />

She's Satan.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
She's your sister!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
She's a bitch!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
She's six!<br />
 <br />
(ANDY shrugs and takes another sip of beer)<br />
<br />
So... who's Beth?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm sorry?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Beth?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh, just a girl I've been...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Ah hah. How long?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
A few weeks.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
How'd you meet?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
At the pool.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
And she lives around here?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah. She went to Roosevelt.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Oh. So you spotted her across the deep end and it was love at first sight?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Not quite.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
What's she like?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
She's nice.<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Wow, you must really think a lot of her.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
What do you want? She's cool, smart</span>. Wants <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b23079")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b23079")' onclick='show("b23079")' id='w23079'>to teach elementary school. Like first graders. (long pause) And she's hot.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
THAT's what I was waiting for!<br />
 <br />
(JACK and ANDY laugh. SKIP and WILL enter. SKIP is waving a sheet of paper in the air)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Look what we found!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
You got it!<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
This is definitely it.<br />
 <br />
(They all rush over to the box.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Hold on! Shouldn't we say something?<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Like what?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I don't know. This is a pretty big moment. I don't want to jump right into it. (looks at SKIP) Skip?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Don't look at me. I don't know what to say.<br />
 <br />
(JACK, SKIP, ANDY, and WILL - all look in the box and try to think of something to say.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I got it! It's been fun - let's get this shit done! (Proud of his rhyming abilities, he sticks his hand in the box.)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(Smacking Andy's hand out of the way) No - that sucked!<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Then you say it!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Fine - I will! (silence) So, here we are... our 2nd annual prank. (silence)<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Wow! No you're right, yours was much better.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I'm not done! So we're back together after one long lonely year apart and tonight we're going to make some history!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Damn straight!<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to SKIP) The paper, my good man.<br />
 <br />
(SKIP hands the paper to WILL. WILL unlocks the box)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
We should have like a signature that we leave behind when we're done.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What do</span> you mean?<br />
 <br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b23080")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b23080")' onclick='show("b23080")' id='w23080'>ANDY<br />
Like a sign. You know like when Zorro does that Z thing.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
We could call ourselves "Los Banditos."<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That'd be sick!<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
And we could each have our own code name. (to ANDY) Like we could call you "Tonto."<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Yeah!<br />
<br />
(JACK laughs)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? (SKIP laughs) What!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Tonto means dumb in Spanish.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Fuck that!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
And you guys can just call me El Guapo!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(dawning on him) Ohhhh! You two are still talking?<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Is he your boyfriend?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I guess.<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Is he cool? What is he like?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yea he's great, why would I date him if he wasn't?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
What does he look like? I'm picturing a big black guy for some reason...<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(laughs) No, he's white.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
And?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
You guys don't want to hear this.<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Sure we do.<br />

WILL<br />
Is he a good kisser?<br />

ANDY<br />
Jesus Christ!<br />

JACK<br />
I'm sorry.<br />

SKIP<br />
(to ANDY) What? What's your problem?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I just don't wanna hear about this. Is that all right?<br />

SKIP<br />
No, actually it's not.<br />

WILL<br />
Skip?<br />

 <br />
ANDY<br />
Nothing. Just forget it.<br />

SKIP<br />
No!<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Listen, I think I've been doing a pretty good job of staying quiet...<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Staying quiet? What, do you want some kind of award for that?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Skip, enough.<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
No! He's said some shitty things to you tonight and I wanna know why. (to ANDY) Is it going to be like this every time we hang out? Do we have to treat it like it's some big secret! He's GAY, Andy, get used to it.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
That's not the point! I just -<br />
