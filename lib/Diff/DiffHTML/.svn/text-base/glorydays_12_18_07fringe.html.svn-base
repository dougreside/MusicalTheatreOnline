<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
REMEMBER WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w17995")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w17995")' onclick='show("w17995")' id='b17995'></span>his backpack <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w17996")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w17996")' onclick='show("w17996")' id='b17996'>down</span> on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)<br />
<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w17997")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w17997")' onclick='show("w17997")' id='b17997'>THIS</span> IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
2<br />
        <br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w17998")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w17998")' onclick='show("w17998")' id='b17998'></span>WORSHIP THEM<br />

JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
 <br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />

IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />

I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />

WE WERE DRIVING<br />

IF IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU<br />
 39<br />
<br />
        <br />
<br />
THAT HE'S CHANGING, FINE<br />
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT HIM<br />
IT DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME<br />
JACK IS GONE TO ME<br />

Don't...<br />

WILL<br />
JUST DON'T GO<br />
I KNOW IT'S NEW <br />
<br />
BUT WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO LEAVE JUST CUZ HE'S OPENED UP<br />
HE'S OUR BEST FRIEND, DON'T WE ASK THAT OF HIM?<br />
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, IT'LL JUST TAKE SOME MORE<br />
TO WORK IN OUR OLD WAY<br />
OKAY?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
NO<br />
I WON'T SAY I DON'T CARE<br />
<br />
I LOOK AND MY FRIEND ISNT THERE<br />
I DON'T LIKE BEING LIED TO<br />

WILL<br />
OH, AND I DO?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG<br />
YOU ALWAYS SEE THE UPSIDE<br />
WHY?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
CAUSE I CAN STILL SEE HIM WHEN I LOOK AT HIS FACE<br />
HE'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT, HE'S JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE<br />
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY<br />
CAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE<br />
WHY GREET THAT CHANGE BY CAUSING HIM PAIN?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT YOU WILL?<br />

WILL<br />
THIS ISN'T WRONG ANDY, THIS IS JUST NEW<br />
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU CANT LOVE HIM<br />
JACK NEVER SAID THAT YOU HAD TO LIVE<br />
YOUR LIFE ONE WAY<br />
LET GO OF YOUR BIAS, HE IS YOUR FRIEND <br />
OR THIS COULD BE<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

LOOK, IM NOT SAYING I DISAGREE<br />
BUT PLEASE, FOR ME, KEEP QUIET<br />
 41<br />

Fine.<br />

SKIP<br />
<br />
The pride parade is back!<br />

(JACK and ANDY don't laugh at this. The tension between them seems pretty obvious. JACK and SKIP set the cases on the player's bench.)<br />

WILL<br />
What did you get?<br />

SKIP<br />
Only the best for my boys! Natty Light!<br />

WILL<br />
(sarcastic) Mmm... Did you steal these from your Dad's fridge?<br />

SKIP<br />
Nope! (proudly) I Bought em.<br />

<br />
How?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
THIS guy!<br />
<br />
(SKIP flashes a fake ID)<br />

WILL<br />
Let me see that.<br />

(SKIP hands the ID to WILL)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(recites the info from memory) Julio Mendez. 5225 Ridgemont Court. Ironwood, Minnesota.   September 7th, 1983.<br />

        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Impressive.<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
I know.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This looks nothing like you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Sure it does!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No it doesn't. This kid is Hispanic. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well it worked didn't it?<br />
<br />
(SKIP takes his ID away from WILL)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(grabbing a beer) You know, I didn't have a single drop of alcohol this past year, and wonder of wonders, I'm still sane.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah but you're gay. See what sobriety can do to you? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Dick.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, that's for you. (noticing ANDY on the bleachers) Whatcha doing up there, champ? (offers ANDY a can) You want one?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Sure.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
K. Catch? (ANDY doesn't respond) Fine, come get it yourself then. (beat) What's his deal?<br />
<br />
(SKIP sets the beer down on the player's bench. ANDY eventually walks down to get it.)<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(WILL, covering, takes a sip.) This stuff is terrible!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Then don't drink it.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Just saying, I thought you had better taste then this.<br />
 43<br />
<br />
        <br />

JACK<br />
(to WILL) Did what's her face call?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
How long are we gonna to wait around for this girl?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I don't know. You got places to be?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
No, I just don't wanna be out here all night! That's all!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Amen to that.<br />
<br />
(Silence. Will tries to cover the awkwardness again.) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to JACK, about SKIP) So what do you think of this new look?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I wasn't gonna say anything but, you kinda look like a pothead. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I think he looks like a woman. <br />
<br />

JACK<br />
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised. I thought you were gonna come back looking like a total Ivy Leauge prep. You know, pink polo with the popped collar...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Never! My roommate was like that. He wore plaid shorts every day of the week. It'd be 15 degrees outside and he'd still be wearing  shorts and boat shoes. Dumbass.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Really!?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah. God, that kid. Whatever.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sounds like your kind of guy.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Not to mention the fact that his dad bought him a Lexus when he graduated from high school. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Jesus. I got a check from my grandma that bounced.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
And the worst part about it is he thinks he's entitled to those things. Like he's owed something for doing nothing. Whatever. It's not worth wasting breath over. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Did that come with the hair too?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
The "Whatever." You've said it like twenty times in the last two minutes.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Sorry.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I just expect more from you. This kid used to be your worst enemy and all you've got is "whatever"? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
What do you want me to say? He hasn't worked a day in his life and still he gets whatever he wants, and it sucks. But nothing I'm gonna do is gonna change that, so why get all upset over it?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
...When you can just grow your hair out.<br />
 45<br />
        <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Exactly! Hence, the "whatever." <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Since when have you ever backed down from a character debate?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Since I saw how pointless they are. Look, I can bitch and moan all I want about him... about anything... but ultimately it doesn't do shit. It's just one opinion. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What?! This coming from the most opinionated guy I know.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
What about Ghandi?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(confused) What about Ghandi?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Think about all the shit he did. That was just one dude!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, but Ghandi didn't live in an age of iPods and On Demand. People would rather sit on their asses and wait for someone else to do what they'd rather not do themselves, just because they can. My roommate isn't any different. So why should I be?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Because you are. You always have been. It's why we're friends.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 I thought we were friends because we sucked at football.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You know what I mean. <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(sarcastic) You mean changing the world and all that.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yes! All that.<br />

Aww, Will, that's cute. But what are you actually doing to CHANGE it? Nothing. Talking on a football field. And that's what makes you just like all the rest of us.<br />

WE COMPLAIN ABOUT OUR PERFECT LIVES WITH BIGGER WORDS THAN MOST<br />
WE SPEW OUT FACTS AND FIND IT RELAXING TO TALK SHIT AS WE BOAST <br />
ABOUT ME AND ME AND ME AND ME, LET'S ALL RAISE A TOAST <br />
<br />
TO THE GENERATION THAT WILL TURN THIS NATION <br />
FROM A SUPERPOWER INTO A GHOST <br />
<br />
OUR FATHERS ARE COMMUTERS, BUT WE'RE STUCK IN OUR COMPUTERS <br />
 WHICH TAKE US ALL AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER, BUT WHO CARES<br />
SO WE'RE TOO OCCUPIED TO NOTICE WHAT WAS THERE HAS DIED <br />
BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WHO USED TO LOVE EACH OTHER, CUZ WHO CARES<br />
THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD WE'RE IN WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT HERE<br />

BUT RATHER THAN FIXING THEM WE'LL JUST JOIN IN WITH THE CHEER<br />
WHO CARES<br />

WE MAY GRADUATE WITH HONORS BUT THERE'S NO HONOR IN IT<br />

WE ARE SMART BUT WE DON'T TRY - THE "DO I HAVE TO?" KIND OF GUY<br />

CHIVALRY AND BRAVERY AND THE QUALITIES WE USED TO BE <br />
ARE NOW ONLY A MEMORY<br />

AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY AFTER ALL<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I ONLY HAD MYSELF<br />
TO GUIDE MY LIFELESS ACTION FIGURES TO THE FLOOR, DOWN FROM THE SHELF<br />
MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY<br />
<br />
THAT I WOULD FIND SOME REAL FRIENDS TO GUIDE ME SOMEDAY<br />
AND NOW<br />

WHEN I FEEL ALONE, I HAVE THESE FRIENDS OF MINE<br />

        <br />
<br />
THEY'VE ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS ON ALL THE THINGS WE SAID WE LOVED<br />
CAUSE EVERYONE'S DECIDED THAT THIS ISNT WHAT IT WAS<br />
WELL NOBODY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT WE'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE<br />
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IM THE ONE WHO'S STILL THE SAME<br />
AND NOW<br />
<br />
I AM STILL ALONE WITH ALL THESE FRIENDS OF MINE<br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME WHO RAN AWAY IN TROUBLED TIMES<br />
<br />
AND NOW I FEEL THE SHAME OF HOLDING ONTO WHAT'S NO LONGER MINE<br />
MAYBE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AFTER ALL<br />
AND I JUST NEVER SAW IT AT ALL<br />

Screw you! (reading) "When we left the field that day becoming friends seemed like a last resort. But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other." <br />

(Will stands up and runs to the bleachers) I mean, how many kids do you think have sat out on these bleachers over the years? How many?(Will runs over to the bleachers and stands on the first row of seats) Who sat here? Huh? (Will runs back to the third row and stands) Who sat here? (The guys laugh. But WILL is driven.) No really! (beat) Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! (Points to where Andy is sitting)<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who that is. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...and even then there are probably thousands of Chris' and Amanda's. <br />
<br />
 59<br />
        <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I bet Amanda's hot! Just saying.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Think about all the stuff that has happened out here. And we're part of it. Cuz we're really here.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You're insane.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No, I just have a vivid imagination. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Hey, do you guys remember when Will told us he was 16 when he wasn't?<br />
<br />
(Everyone explodes laughing, except for WILL of course)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I haven't thought about that in so long. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Yea, why did you lie about that? You knew we were gonna find out when we got our drivers' licenses.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You had me for a while though, I totally bought the "my mom wants me to wait until she thinks I'm ready."<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Cuz your mom would so do that. That lady is crazy.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Crazy hot! <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Gentlemen, Andy Scott, case in point.<br />
   <br />
ANDY<br />
Glad to be here, glad to be here.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I remember the day we caught you too. We were at Andy's house and your mom was like... (laughs) "It's gonna be so nice of you boys to drive Willy around for a year until he TURNS 16." WHAAAAAAAAAT? <br />
<br />
<br />
(Everyone laughs)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Listen jerks! Everything was going great, I didn't want the fact that we were different ages to mess anything up.<br />
 60<br />
        <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You're OCD. <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
It doesn't matter if our ages are symmetrical.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Don't you mean identical?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You should be proud. You skipped Kindergarten! That means you're smarter than us.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, who skips Kindergarten? Of all grades. "Oh, young William? He plays with blocks better than the other kids. Bump him!"<br />
<br />
(They all laugh. WILL's phone rings, Goofy ring.)<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Is that really your ring?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yikes man. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Screw you. (answers the phone) Hello!? Patty? Hey! Hi. So did you... Really!? (disappointed) Oh.   <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(into the phone) Don't worry about it. No no it's okay. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What did she say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Thanks anyway. (beat)  Umm... yeah I'm actually busy Thursday night too so.... Uh-huh. Yeah that's a bad night too. Remember- broken bones. I got broken bones. Okay well gotta run, but I'll talk to you later. Okay. Great! Bye. (hangs up the phone) Jesus.<br />
 61<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(to WILL) What's wrong?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That girl does not give up.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
No, what's up with the key!?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Well... she says it's in the building.  <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently it may be in the maintenance closet. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
So what did she give us?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
She doesn't know, but now she's pretty sure it's in there. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(sarcastic) Well that's great, we probably have his car keys. What are we supposed to do now?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
(beat) You know... we could always try and sneak into the building?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You think?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
How?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
There's that window in the gym. I used to sneak out of it during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />
<br />
ARE YOU READY REPRISE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
AREN'T YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I'VE BEEN READY SINCE 5 YEARS AGO<br />
 62<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
TRESPASSING'S A CRIME, YOU KNOW<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
THEN WE'LL ABORT IF COPS SHOW<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I like where your head's at.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I DUNNO...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
ARE YOU SCARED NOW?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
NO<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'LL GO WITH YOU<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to JACK and WILL) IF YOU SEE SOMEONE FIND SOMETHIN LOUD TO DO<br />
<br />
SKIP and THE GUYS<br />
<br />
NOW ARE YOU READY FOR READY FOR TONIGHT...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
All right. Let's fucking do this!<br />
<br />
(SKIP and ANDY exit, whooping and hollering. WILL and JACK are left alone.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
SSShhhhhhhhhhhhh! Guys!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Long silence) <br />
<br />
    So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
 63<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No. There isn't. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Kissed?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
About what? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You know. I mean, was it something that you've always known or...<br />
 64<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, long beat)<br />
<br />
    Does it bother you?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question, you know?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
 65<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or something. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN   <br />
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
 66<br />
        <br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 67<br />
        <br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away.  Silence.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What was that for?<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
What are you doing?<br />
<br />
(JACK and WILL pull away from each other)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Shit. <br />

Will, what are you DOING?!<br />

WILL<br />
Andy, stop!  We need to talk about this.. <br />

You're right! I'm sorry. But it's not what you -<br />

JACK<br />
(overlapping WILL)<br />
<br />
Andy, please, can we talk for a second?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to Jack) You came here tonight and dropped this shit on us and assumed that everything would be fine. It's NOT fine. You lied to us -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, Jesus, he didn't lie to you! <br />
<br />
WILL <br />
Guys, please just calm down -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(overlapping WILL)<br />
No, you lied to me too, Andy. Will told me what you said.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Jack - <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
That you couldn't deal with it. That you've been sitting here all night and you didn't want to say anything. Why not, why wouldn't you just talk to me?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) Why would you tell him that....<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was being a good friend, Andy. I think I have the right to know that.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) I don't believe you. <br />

 69 <br />

ANDY<br />

Why not!? <br />

JACK <br />
I didn't tell you earlier, because I wasn't ready yet, Andy-<br />

Look, do whatever you want. I'm going.<br />

SKIP<br />
Why? What the fuck is your deal right now?<br />

WILL<br />
Everybody STOP IT! (to ANDY) You're right! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look its over. Just stay and we'll figure it out.(ANDY starts to leave) Andy, don't!(grabbing him) <br />

JACK<br />
(to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
<br />
SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, maybe not. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know, but when the hell did that happen?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Good question.<br />
<br />
BOYS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN WE WERE BOYS<br />
<br />
WE HAD FUN<br />
AND BLAMED MISTAKES ON BEING HUMAN<br />
<br />
BUT NOW WE'RE OLD<br />
AND EVEN ONE<br />
WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN<br />
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND<br />
<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT HE AND I DID<br />
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER WE WERE SO SURE<br />
THAT WE'D NEVER STOP BEING BOYS ANYMORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU THINK IS DEAD<br />
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE YOUR LIFE IS OVER<br />
 78<br />
<br />
        <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT FEELS THAT WAY<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT NO ONE SAID<br />
WE CANT SCREW UP WHEN WE GET OLDER<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
WE WERE SO PERFECT TIL TODAY<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT<br />
THE GOOD OLD DAYS<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
NEVER STAY<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
<br />
MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID<br />
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE<br />
BUT DOES THAT MEAN WE CANT BE BOYS ANYMORE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING<br />
  <br />
THAT I COULD BE LOSING YOU<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
NOBODY IS LOSING<br />
EVERYONE'S JUST GROWING TOO<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHAT IF THIS WAS NEVER RIGHT<br />
AND IT TOOK US UP UNTIL TONIGHT <br />
TO REALIZE WE'D BEEN SAVING FACE<br />
AND ADMIT WE ARE OUT OF PLACE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE WERE WRONG<br />
JUST CAUSE WE DIDN'T GET ALONG<br />
FOR ONE DAY<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I AM NOT READY TO STOP BEING A KID<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
WELL NOBODY SAID THAT WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED<br />
 79<br />
        <br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
WE'LL NEVER BE WHO WE WERE BEFORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
BUT NEVER SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BOYS...<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
(tradeoff)<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
<br />
(A long silence)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
God I hate this place. Why couldn't we have gone to Andy's and watched Ella Enchanted? (beat) I'm gonna go.  You want a ride?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, that's okay.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
You sure?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah...I think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
All right. We're gonna be okay. I promise.<br />
<br />
(SKIP starts to exit.)<br />
<br />
Oh I almost forgot.<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP pulls a key out of his pocket and tosses it to WILL)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You found it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(smiles) Thanks.<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Hey. I love you, ok?<br />
 80<br />
<br />
        <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know. I love you too.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Night buddy.<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
<br />
    Night man.<br />
<br />
(SKIP exits.)<br />
<br />
MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
 81<br />
        <br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />
CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)<br />

GLORY DAYS<br />
A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />
<br />
<br />
    (A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
REMEMBER WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
(WILL sets <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b17995")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b17995")' onclick='show("b17995")' id='w17995'>down</span> his backpack<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b17996")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b17996")' onclick='show("b17996")' id='w17996'></span> on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b17997")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b17997")' onclick='show("b17997")' id='w17997'>HERE</span> IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
<br />
2<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b17998")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b17998")' onclick='show("b17998")' id='w17998'>TO</span> WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL begins flipping through the pages of <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b17999")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b17999")' onclick='show("b17999")' id='w17999'>the</span> notebook)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
<br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
 <br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

Well<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b18233")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b18233")' onclick='show("b18233")' id='w18233'></span>, I wanna know everything! Where'd you go? What'd you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!<br />

ANDY<br />

JACK<br />
Okay...<br />
<br />
<br />
THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL<br />
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP<br />
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You kissed your Mom Dude? Gross...  <br />
<br />
<br />
 35<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR<br />
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT<br />
BUT I DIDN'T CARE<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />

THINGS ARE DIFFERENT<br />

DON'T LOOK AT ME THAT WAY<br />

THAT HE'S CHANGING, FINE<br />

BUT WHEN I LOOK AT HIM<br />
IT DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME<br />
JACK IS GONE TO ME<br />
I JUST WATCHED HIM DISAPPEAR<br />

JUST DON'T GO<br />
I KNOW IT'S NEW <br />

HE'S OUR BEST FRIEND, DON'T WE ASK THAT OF HIM?<br />
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, IT'LL JUST TAKE SOME MORE<br />

TO WORK IN OUR OLD WAY<br />
OKAY?<br />

NO<br />
I WON'T SAY I DON'T CARE<br />

ANDY<br />
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG<br />
YOU ALWAYS SEE THE UPSIDE<br />
WHY?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
CAUSE I CAN STILL SEE HIM WHEN I LOOK AT HIS FACE<br />
HE'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT, HE'S JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE<br />
<br />
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY<br />
CAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE<br />
WHY GREET THAT CHANGE BY CAUSING HIM PAIN?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT YOU WILL?<br />

ANDY<br />
LOOK, THIS ISNT MY BURDEN<br />

YOU'RE HIS FRIEND<br />

DONT MAKE IT SOUND <br />

YOU'RE NOT<br />

WILL<br />
THIS ISN'T WRONG ANDY, THIS IS JUST NEW<br />
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU CANT LOVE HIM<br />
JACK NEVER SAID THAT YOU HAD TO LIVE<br />

LET GO OF YOUR BIAS, HE IS YOUR FRIEND <br />

What did you get?<br />

Only the best for my boys! Natty Light!<br />

Nope! (proudly) I Bought em.<br />

How?<br />

JACK<br />
Impressive.<br />

SKIP<br />
I know.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />

This looks nothing like you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Sure it does!<br />

No it doesn't. This kid is Hispanic. <br />

Well it worked didn't it?<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP takes his ID away from WILL)<br />

JACK<br />
(grabbing a beer) You know, I didn't have a single drop of alcohol this past year, and wonder of wonders, I'm still sane.<br />

Yeah but you're gay. See what sobriety can do to you? <br />

JACK<br />
<br />
Dick.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, that's for you. (noticing ANDY on the bleachers) Whatcha doing up there, champ? (offers ANDY a can) You want one?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Sure.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
K. Catch? (ANDY doesn't respond) Fine, come get it yourself then. (beat) What's his deal?<br />
<br />

(SKIP sets the beer down on the player's bench. ANDY eventually walks down to get it.)<br />
WILL<br />
(WILL, covering, takes a sip.) This stuff is terrible!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Then don't drink it.<br />

Nope.<br />

Amen to that.<br />

<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to JACK, about SKIP) So what do you think of this new look?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I wasn't gonna say anything but, you kinda look like a pothead. <br />

WILL<br />
I think he looks like a woman. <br />

JACK<br />
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised. I thought you were gonna come back looking like a total Ivy Leauge prep. You know, pink polo with the popped collar...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Never! My roommate was like that. He wore plaid shorts every day of the week. It'd be 15 degrees outside and he'd still be wearing  shorts and boat shoes. Dumbass.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Really!?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah. God, that kid. Whatever.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sounds like your kind of guy.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that his dad bought him a Lexus when he graduated from high school. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Jesus. I got a check from my grandma that bounced.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
And the worst part about it is he thinks he's entitled to those things. Like he's owed something for doing nothing. Whatever. It's not worth wasting breath over. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Did that come with the hair too?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
The "Whatever." You've said it like twenty times in the last two minutes.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Sorry.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I just expect more from you. This kid used to be your worst enemy and all you've got is "whatever"? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What do you want me to say? He hasn't worked a day in his life and still he gets whatever he wants, and it sucks. But nothing I'm gonna do is gonna change that, so why get all upset over it?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
...When you can just grow your hair out.<br />
<br />
 45<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Exactly! Hence, the "whatever." <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Since when have you ever backed down from a character debate?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Since I saw how pointless they are. Look, I can bitch and moan all I want about him... about anything... but ultimately it doesn't do shit. It's just one opinion. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
What?! This coming from the most opinionated guy I know.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What about Ghandi?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(confused) What about Ghandi?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Think about all the shit he did. That was just one dude!<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, but Ghandi didn't live in an age of iPods and On Demand. People would rather sit on their asses and wait for someone else to do what they'd rather not do themselves, just because they can. My roommate isn't any different. So why should I be?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Because you are. You always have been. It's why we're friends.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 I thought we were friends because we sucked at football.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You know what I mean. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(sarcastic) You mean changing the world and all that.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yes! All that.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Aww, Will, that's cute. But what are you actually doing to CHANGE it? Nothing. Talking on a football field. And that's what makes you just like all the rest of us.<br />

Yes you are, you just don't notice.<br />

SKIP<br />
WE'RE ALL VIRGINS WHO ARE BURGEONING WITH READINESS FOR MORE<br />
BUT WE'VE GOT PORNOS IN OUR DRAWERS<br />
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THE DOOR <br />
WE FEED A NEED TO NEVER BLEED UNLESS WE'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE <br />
WE GO THROUGH PAINSTAKING MEANS TO NEVER FEEL PAIN ANYMORE <br />

WE USED TO BE YOUNG AND STUPID BUT NOW WE'RE JUST YOUNG <br />
<br />
CAUSE WE DON'T ADMIT THE STUPID SHIT WE'VE DONE NOW THAT REAL LIFE HAS BEGUN<br />

Skip -<br />

SKIP<br />
Am I wrong?<br />
<br />
WE COMPLAIN ABOUT OUR PERFECT LIVES WITH BIGGER WORDS THAN MOST<br />
<br />
WE SPEW OUT FACTS AND FIND IT RELAXING TO TALK SHIT AS WE BOAST <br />
ABOUT ME AND ME AND ME AND ME, LET'S ALL RAISE A TOAST <br />
TO THE GENERATION THAT WILL TURN THIS NATION <br />
FROM A SUPERPOWER INTO A GHOST <br />
<br />
OUR FATHERS ARE COMMUTERS, BUT WE'RE STUCK IN OUR COMPUTERS <br />
 WHICH TAKE US ALL AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER, BUT WHO CARES<br />
SO WE'RE TOO OCCUPIED TO NOTICE WHAT WAS THERE HAS DIED <br />
<br />
BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WHO USED TO LOVE EACH OTHER, CUZ WHO CARES<br />
THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD WE'RE IN WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT HERE<br />
BUT RATHER THAN FIXING THEM WE'LL JUST JOIN IN WITH THE CHEER<br />
WHO CARES<br />
WHO CARES<br />
WHO CARES WHO CARES WHO CARES<br />
WHO CARES?<br />
<br />
WE MAY GRADUATE WITH HONORS BUT THERE'S NO HONOR IN IT<br />
<br />
WE ARE RUNNING A RACE BUT WE'RE OKAY IF WE DON'T WIN IT <br />
WE ARE SMART BUT WE DON'T TRY - THE "DO I HAVE TO?" KIND OF GUY<br />
WHO'LL NEVER RISK AND NEVER FAIL IF HE CAN SPIN IT <br />
CHIVALRY AND BRAVERY AND THE QUALITIES WE USED TO BE <br />
ARE NOW ONLY A MEMORY<br />

WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I ONLY HAD MYSELF<br />
TO GUIDE MY LIFELESS ACTION FIGURES TO THE FLOOR, DOWN FROM THE SHELF<br />
MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY<br />
<br />
THAT I WOULD FIND SOME REAL FRIENDS TO GUIDE ME SOMEDAY<br />
AND NOW<br />

WHEN I FEEL ALONE, I HAVE THESE FRIENDS OF MINE<br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME, WHO KEEP ME SANE IN TROUBLED TIMES<br />

 48<br />

THEY'VE ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS ON ALL THE THINGS WE SAID WE LOVED<br />
CAUSE EVERYONE'S DECIDED THAT THIS ISNT WHAT IT WAS<br />
WELL NOBODY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT WE'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE<br />
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IM THE ONE WHO'S STILL THE SAME<br />
AND NOW<br />
<br />
I AM STILL ALONE WITH ALL THESE FRIENDS OF MINE<br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME WHO RAN AWAY IN TROUBLED TIMES<br />
AND NOW I FEEL THE SHAME OF HOLDING ONTO WHAT'S NO LONGER MINE<br />

ANDY<br />
Screw you! (reading) "When we left the field that day becoming friends seemed like a last resort. But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other." <br />

That's not a number, Jack.<br />

Think about all those kids that graduated in our class that we never even knew. Like, remember that skinny kid with the thick glasses who always farted in gym?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Fahid?<br />

WILL<br />
Yeah him!  He'll forever be known as the kid you never wanted to follow behind during the rope climb. And that's probably all we'll ever know him as.<br />

He also borrowed my pen during Calculus and never gave it back. I'll never forget that. <br />

How many?(Will runs over to the bleachers and stands on the first row of seats) Who sat here? Huh? (Will runs back to the third row and stands) Who sat here? (The guys laugh. But WILL is driven.) No really! (beat) Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! (Points to where Andy is sitting)<br />

ANDY<br />
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who that is. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...and even then there are probably thousands of Chris' and Amanda's. <br />

We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Thanks anyway. (beat)  Umm... yeah I'm actually busy Thursday night too so.... Uh-huh. Yeah that's a bad night too. Remember- broken bones.

ANDY<br />
(sarcastic) Well that's great, we probably have his car keys. What are we supposed to do now?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) You know... we could always try and sneak into the building?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You think?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
How?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
There's that window in the gym. I used to sneak out of it during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />
<br />
ARE YOU READY REPRISE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
AREN'T YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'VE BEEN READY SINCE 5 YEARS AGO<br />
<br />
 62<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
TRESPASSING'S A CRIME, YOU KNOW<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
THEN WE'LL ABORT IF COPS SHOW<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I like where your head's at.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I DUNNO...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
ARE YOU SCARED NOW?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I'LL GO WITH YOU<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to JACK and WILL) IF YOU SEE SOMEONE FIND SOMETHIN LOUD TO DO<br />
<br />
SKIP and THE GUYS<br />
NOW ARE YOU READY FOR READY FOR TONIGHT...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
All right. Let's fucking do this!<br />
<br />
(SKIP and ANDY exit, whooping and hollering. WILL and JACK are left alone.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
SSShhhhhhhhhhhhh! Guys!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence) <br />
<br />
<br />
    So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
<br />
 63<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No. There isn't. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Kissed?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
About what? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You know. I mean, was it something that you've always known or...<br />
<br />
<br />
 64<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, long beat)<br />
<br />
    Does it bother you?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question, you know?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
 65<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or something. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN   <br />
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
 66<br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
 67<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away.  Silence.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What was that for?<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What are you doing?<br />
<br />
<br />
(JACK and WILL pull away from each other)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Shit. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, what are you DOING?!<br />
<br />
(ANDY yanks WILL away from JACK)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Andy, calm down. It was nothing.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
NOTHING?! That was nothing?<br />

SKIP<br />
What's going on?<br />

JACK<br />
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -<br />

ANDY<br />
I don't believe this.<br />
<br />
(ANDY grabs his jacket off the bleachers)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, stop!  We need to talk about this.. <br />
<br />
 68<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(boiling.) Will. Do. You. Realize what you just did?! <br />

WILL<br />
You're right! I'm sorry. But it's not what you -<br />

WILL<br />
Andy, come on -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(overlapping WILL)<br />
Andy, please, can we talk for a second?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to Jack) You came here tonight and dropped this shit on us and assumed that everything would be fine. It's NOT fine. You lied to us -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Oh, Jesus, he didn't lie to you! <br />
<br />
WILL <br />
Guys, please just calm down -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(overlapping WILL)<br />
No, you lied to me too, Andy. Will told me what you said.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Jack - <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
That you couldn't deal with it. That you've been sitting here all night and you didn't want to say anything. Why not, why wouldn't you just talk to me?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) Why would you tell him that....<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was being a good friend, Andy. I think I have the right to know that.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) I don't believe you. <br />
<br />
<br />
 69 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Why is this bothering you so much?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm not having this conversation.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Why not!? <br />
<br />
JACK <br />
I didn't tell you earlier, because I wasn't ready yet, Andy-<br />

ANDY<br />
Look, do whatever you want. I'm going.<br />

(ANDY starts to exit)<br />

SKIP<br />
Why? What the fuck is your deal right now?<br />

WILL<br />
Everybody STOP IT! (to ANDY) You're right! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look its over. Just stay and we'll figure it out.(ANDY starts to leave) Andy, don't!(grabbing him) <br />

WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG<br />

THAT I MAY BE WRONG<br />
AND NO I DON'T BELONG HERE<br />
BUT IT WAS YOU WHO MADE IT SO<br />
<br />
    <br />
    I'm going home.<br />
    <br />
    (ANDY exits.)<br />
<br />
    SKIP<br />
        Andy -<br />
<br />
    <br />
(WILL, near tears, is on the ground, trying to piece together his journal)<br />
<br />
What was he talking about? You lied to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything about it, cause I didn't want him to fuck anything up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing?  Something you wanna tell me?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know.<br />
<br />
(WILL continues to pick up the pieces of the notebook)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.<br />
<br />
(SKIP kneels down to help)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, maybe not. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know, but when the hell did that happen?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Good question.<br />
<br />
BOYS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN WE WERE BOYS<br />
<br />
WE HAD FUN<br />
AND BLAMED MISTAKES ON BEING HUMAN<br />
<br />
BUT NOW WE'RE OLD<br />
AND EVEN ONE<br />
WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN<br />
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND<br />
<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT HE AND I DID<br />
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER WE WERE SO SURE<br />
THAT WE'D NEVER STOP BEING BOYS ANYMORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU THINK IS DEAD<br />
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE YOUR LIFE IS OVER<br />
<br />
 78<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT FEELS THAT WAY<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT NO ONE SAID<br />
WE CANT SCREW UP WHEN WE GET OLDER<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WE WERE SO PERFECT TIL TODAY<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT<br />
THE GOOD OLD DAYS<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
NEVER STAY<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID<br />
<br />
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE<br />
BUT DOES THAT MEAN WE CANT BE BOYS ANYMORE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING<br />
  <br />
THAT I COULD BE LOSING YOU<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
NOBODY IS LOSING<br />
<br />
EVERYONE'S JUST GROWING TOO<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHAT IF THIS WAS NEVER RIGHT<br />
AND IT TOOK US UP UNTIL TONIGHT <br />
TO REALIZE WE'D BEEN SAVING FACE<br />
AND ADMIT WE ARE OUT OF PLACE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE WERE WRONG<br />
<br />
JUST CAUSE WE DIDN'T GET ALONG<br />
FOR ONE DAY<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I AM NOT READY TO STOP BEING A KID<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
WELL NOBODY SAID THAT WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED<br />
<br />
 79<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
WE'LL NEVER BE WHO WE WERE BEFORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT NEVER SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BOYS...<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
(tradeoff)<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
<br />
(A long silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
God I hate this place. Why couldn't we have gone to Andy's and watched Ella Enchanted? (beat) I'm gonna go.  You want a ride?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, that's okay.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You sure?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah...I think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
All right. We're gonna be okay. I promise.<br />
<br />
(SKIP starts to exit.)<br />
<br />
Oh I almost forgot.<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP pulls a key out of his pocket and tosses it to WILL)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You found it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Hey. I love you, ok?<br />
<br />
 80<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I know. I love you too.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Night buddy.<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
    Night man.<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP exits.)<br />
<br />
MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
<br />
<br />
 81<br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />
CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)<br />
<br />
THE END.<br />
<br />
<br />
GLORY DAYS<br />
