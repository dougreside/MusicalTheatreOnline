A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />

    <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w49227")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w49227")' onclick='show("w49227")' id='b49227'>He opens his notebook and begins to read</span>)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />
Page 1<br />
    <br />
    SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w49228")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w49228")' onclick='show("w49228")' id='b49228'>begins flipping through the pages</span> of his <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w49229")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w49229")' onclick='show("w49229")' id='b49229'>notebook</span>)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

ANDY<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?  <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />

Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own. <br />

Why don't we try hanging out for a change? You ever think of that?<br />

ANDY<br />
We are.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally together in the same place. Isn't that enough? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Sorry.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Think about it. We don't have to associate ourselves with this place ever again, so why do you wanna come back and pull some stupid prank? We're past that.<br />

Oh that makes a ton of sense. (beat) Will. You really think they're gonna start respecting us for setting off sprinklers during their little charity football game?<br />

They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?<br />

I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />

WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I ONLY HAD MYSELF<br />
TO GUIDE MY LIFELESS ACTION FIGURES TO THE FLOOR, DOWN FROM THE SHELF<br />
MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY<br />

    But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other."<br />

Well... there's that window in the gym. The one we used to sneak out of during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />
<br />

SSShhhhhhhhhhhhh! Guys! <br />

JACK<br />
They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence) <br />
<br />
    So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No. There isn't. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Kissed?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
        <br />
        Page 64<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? <br />
<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w49330")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w49330")' onclick='show("w49330")' id='b49330'>JACK<br />
About what? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You know</span>. I mean, was it something that you always knew or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And I <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w49331")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w49331")' onclick='show("w49331")' id='b49331'>kind of</span> just pushed it away. I'd <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w49332")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w49332")' onclick='show("w49332")' id='b49332'>think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept</span> telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w49333")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w49333")' onclick='show("w49333")' id='b49333'>long</span> beat)<br />
<br />
    Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
        <br />
        Page 65<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
    <br />
    Page 66<br />
<br />
    IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />

WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
<br />
        <br />
        Page 67<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away.  Silence.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What was that for?<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What are you doing?<br />
<br />
(JACK and WILL pull away from each other)<br />

Shit. <br />

(to WILL) Why would you tell him that....<br />

<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />

SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />

SKIP<br />
God I hate this place. Why couldn't we have gone to Andy's and watched Ella Enchanted? (beat) I'm gonna go.  You want a ride?<br />

WILL<br />
No, that's okay.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You sure?<br />

SKIP<br />
All right. We're gonna be okay. I promise.<br />

Oh I almost forgot.<br />

WILL<br />
You found it.<br />

SKIP<br />
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. <br />

MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
<br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
  <br />
  Page 81<br />
<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
    AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY    <br />
    <br />
    Page 82<br />
<br />
    CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />

(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
 LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />

WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
  <br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
  <br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />

        <br />

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />

CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
<br />
YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />

WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />

ANDY<br />
 Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />

  He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?<br />

She is not, shut up!<br />

We are.<br />

SKIP<br />
No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally together in the same place. Isn't that enough? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Sorry.<br />

SKIP<br />

Think about it. We don't have to associate ourselves with this place ever again, so why do you wanna come back and pull some stupid prank? We're past that.<br />

Will it was five years ago!<br />

They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?<br />

But Will, they're not gonna care. They never did, so why would they start now?<br />

AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />

I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
  <br />
  AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />

AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />

MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY<br />
THAT I WOULD FIND SOME REAL FRIENDS TO GUIDE ME SOMEDAY<br />

        <br />
But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other." <br />

 Well... there's that window in the gym. The one we used to sneak out of during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />
<br />
ARE YOU READY REPRISE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 AREN'T YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 I'VE BEEN READY SINCE 5 YEARS AGO<br />

JACK<br />
 TRESPASSING'S A CRIME, YOU KNOW<br />

SKIP<br />
 THEN WE'LL ABORT IF COPS SHOW<br />

ANDY<br />

WILL<br />
<br />
 NO<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

ANDY<br />
 All right. Let's fucking do this!<br />

(SKIP and ANDY exit, whooping and hollering. WILL and JACK are left alone.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 SSShhhhhhhhhhhhh! Guys!<br />

        <br />
JACK<br />
 They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence) <br />
<br />
<br />
So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 No. There isn't. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Who?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Kissed?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
<br />
 <br />
Page 64<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
 (laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Yea. How long have you known? <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b49330")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b49330")' onclick='show("b49330")' id='w49330'></span>I mean, was it something that you always knew or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 (wryly) Why so curious?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Well... I think part of me has always known and I <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b49331")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b49331")' onclick='show("b49331")' id='w49331'></span>just pushed it away. I'd <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b49332")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b49332")' onclick='show("b49332")' id='w49332'>keep</span> telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b49333")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b49333")' onclick='show("b49333")' id='w49333'></span>beat)<br />
<br />
<br />
Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 No, of course not. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 (caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
 <br />
 Page 65<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 (beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 What'd he say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 ...Yeah.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
 <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
   THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
<br />
  SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
  <br />
Page 66<br />
        <br />
  IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
  <br />
<br />
  WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
  THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 MAYBE<br />
  THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
  IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
  THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
  MAYBE<br />
  THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
  JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
  SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
  AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
  HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
  WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
  THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
  WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
 IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
<br />
 CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
  <br />
Page 67<br />
<br />
        <br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
  THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 ANDY<br />
  THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
  IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 ANDY<br />
  THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
  IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
 I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
<br />
  THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away. Silence.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 What was that for?<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
 What are you doing?<br />
<br />
(JACK and WILL pull away from each other)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Shit. <br />

 Will, what are you DOING?!<br />

 I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -<br />

ANDY<br />
 I don't believe this.<br />

(ANDY grabs his jacket off the bleachers)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Andy, stop!  We need to talk about this... <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 (boiling.) Will. Do. You. Realize what you just did?! <br />

WILL<br />
<br />
 Andy, come on -<br />
<br />
 JACK<br />
  (overlapping WILL)<br />
 Andy, please, can we talk for a second?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 (to Jack) You came here tonight and dropped this shit on us and thought that everything would be fine. It's NOT fine. You lied to us -<br />

ANDY<br />
 What?<br />

JACK<br />
 That you couldn't deal with it. That you've been sitting here all night not saying anything. Why not, why don't you just talk to me?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 (to WILL) Why would you tell him that....<br />
<br />
JACK<br />

JACK<br />
(to ANDY)<br />
 THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
  YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
  THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
  CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
<br />
 BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
  I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
  CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
  THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
  <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b49347")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b49347")' onclick='show("b49347")' id='w49347'></span>CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
  WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
<br />
  SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
  WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
 SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
  THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
  DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
<br />
   WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
  SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
  WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(overlapping)<br />
 ...LOOK WHO'S "SPEAKING OUT"<br />
<br />
  LIKE HE KNOWS ABOUT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
  JUST PUT THE BLAME ON ME<br />
  THEN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT<br />
<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
 YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
  WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL<br />
  SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
   WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
 SO BEFORE I GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
  THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
  DONT FUCK WITH OTHER<br />
  UNLESS THEY WANT TO LOSE EACH OTHER<br />
  WELL, YOU JUST LOST ME<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 YOU DON'T CARE HOW I FEEL<br />
  SO WHY SHOULD I CARE WHAT I SAY TO YOU?<br />
  NO, I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
  THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
  DON'T FUCK WITH EACH OTHER<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

        <br />
SKIP<br />
 Why would you say that to him?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 I wasn't calling him that!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 He's supposed to be one of your best friends and you treat him like he wronged you. He did nothing to you. <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 Skip -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 You just fucked up a friendship for all of us because you're too selfish to get that it's not always about YOU!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 Can I please say something?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 No! Everything that's coming out of your mouth tonight is toxic, and I'm tired of listening to it. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 I would never call him -<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Andy, stop -<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 No! (to SKIP) It's not about him being gay, Skip, it's about - <br />

 I don't wanna hear it! No one does - <br />

  THE NIGHTS OUT HERE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE<br />

SKIP<br />
 About what?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything, cause I didn't want anything to get fucked up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing anyways?  Something you wanna tell me?<br />

WILL<br />
 No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.<br />

 You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.<br />

WILL<br />
 I know.<br />

SKIP<br />
 (beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.<br />

WILL<br />
 (smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. <br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
 Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Yeah, maybe not. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />

 I know, but when the hell did that happen?<br />

 Good question.<br />

BOYS<br />

 WHEN WE WERE BOYS<br />
 WE HAD FUN<br />

 BUT NOW WE'RE OLD<br />
<br />
AND EVEN ONE<br />
 WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN<br />
<br />
 YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN<br />
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND<br />
<br />
 ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
 ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT ALL OF US DID<br />

MY NEXT STORY<br />
 <br />
 LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
 INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
 CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
 <br />
Page 81<br />
        <br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
<br />
 IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
  AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
 BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />
<br />
Page 82<br />
        <br />

CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />
