ANDY<br />
(reading)"Come one, come all to the Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." What!? The FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! <br />

Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own.<br />

ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />

WILL<br />

Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend."<br />

Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please.<br />

IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />

AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />

They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />

WILL<br />
No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence)<br />
<br />
    So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No. There isn't. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />

Who?<br />

WILL<br />
The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />

JACK<br />
Kissed?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
        <br />
        Page 64<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
About what? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You know. I mean, was it something that you've always known or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so inquisitive?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And I kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, long beat)<br />
<br />
    Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
        <br />
        Page 65<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO</span> THE FACT THAT <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w43003")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w43003")' onclick='show("w43003")' id='b43003'>HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />

THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />

JACK AND WILL<br />

THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />

YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />

BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
    <br />
    73<br />
<br />
    CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />

ANDY<br />
(overlapping)<br />
...LOOK WHO'S "SPEAKING OUT"<br />

WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL<br />

THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DONT FUCK WITH OTHER<br />
UNLESS THEY WANT TO LOSE EACH OTHER<br />
WELL, YOU JUST LOST ME<br />

ANDY<br />

I wasn't calling him that!<br />

SKIP<br />
Honestly, where is the disconnect in your  brain! He's supposed to be one of your best friends and you treat him like he wronged you. He did nothing to you.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Skip -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You just fucked up a friendship for all of us because you're too selfish to get that it's not always about YOU!<br />

SKIP<br />
No! Everything that's coming out of your mouth tonight is toxic, and I'm tired of listening to it.<br />

        WERE WORTH NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING!!<br />

WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOYS?<br />

NOW IT IS MY TURN TO ASK YOU <br />
    WHAT TO DO?<br />
    WHEN AFTER FIVE YEARS<br />
    I DON'T TRUCT YOU<br />
    WE'VE BEEN BROTHERS FOR SO LONG<br />
<br />
    AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE - <br />

IT IS MY TURN<br />
    TO GO<br />

    I'VE NEVER HAD A GIFT LIKE YOURS FOR CLEVER WORDS TO SAY<br />

What was he talking about? You lied to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything, cause I didn't want anything to get fucked up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing anyways?  Something you wanna tell me?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know.<br />
<br />
(WILL continues to pick up the pieces of the notebook)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.<br />
<br />
(SKIP kneels down to help)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip... everything I've ever felt was in this thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, maybe not. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />

I know, but when the hell did that happen?<br />

WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN<br />
<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN<br />
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />

ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID<br />
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE<br />

<br />
WILL<br />
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING<br />
  <br />
  Page 79<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
NOBODY IS LOSING<br />
EVERYONE'S JUST GROWING TOO<br />

MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY<br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT</span> SEEM TO <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w43008")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w43008")' onclick='show("w43008")' id='b43008'>COMPLETE<br />

IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW<br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />

Oh come on, it's a good story! I hooked her and Will up on a little dinner date. Imagine if you will... Will drives to the house. He's got on a nice shirt. He walks up, rings the doorbell, and there's Abby. And she's looking FINE. She's all ready to go out for a night on the town, but, suddenly Will decides he has to "use the bathroom." (to WILL) Tell Skip what you said.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
About what?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
To Abby!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
"May I use your bathroom?"<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
And BANG, he's in the house! So while Abby's showing him the bathroom, I'm sneaking in the front door. I hide in the closet. Will takes a fake leak, all done, they leave, I pull off some 007 shit, grab the keys, and I'm out like magic.<br />

TO BE ASS BACKWARDS <br />
AND GO AGAINST THE GRAIN FROM BEING SO NORMAL <br />
THAT IT MAKES YOU GO INSANE<br />

<br />
WILL and ANDY<br />
BECAUSE ASS BACKWARDS <br />

Will, this whole thing is really childish.<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You didn't think that last year.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
That prank was stupid too. The next day they printed out new copies of the diplomas.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but they didn't have them for the ceremony.<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
So? Those assholes still graduated. The world didn't spin off its axis. It was a minor inconvenience at best.<br />

JACK<br />
Plus we could've been expelled for that.<br />

But we weren't! Come on, what happened to you guys? You used to love shit like this!<br />

WILL<br />
Come on guys. It's only the sprinklers.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ALL<br />
(WILL starts as the others join in gradually)<br />
WE CAN TRY <br />
TO BE ASS BACKWARDS AND RISE ABOVE THE REST <br />
AND BE ASS BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF BEING THE BEST <br />
ASS BACKWARDS IS SEEING OUR LIVES FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES <br />
EACH OTHER'S EYES<br />
<br />
 <br />
BEING ASS BACKWARDS <br />
AND LEARNING FROM OUR FRIENDS THAT BEING ASS BACKWARDS <br />
MEANS FRIENDSHIP NEVER ENDS <br />

Alright. Fine, let's do it.<br />

Great!<br />

 <br />
JACK<br />
Thursday.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Right. Okay. It's set to go off at... 1:30 tonight.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Graduation starts at 2:00 tomorrow.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
So we'll set it for 2:30! Sound good?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Works for me.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
2:30 it is. (Starts punching in numbers) Hour...2.... (Pause) Hour...2.  Shit!!<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
What?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
It's got a password.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
No it doesn't!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Yes, Andy, it clearly does.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Where?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
There, where it says "password."<br />
 <br />
(ANDY stares at the screen. Silence)<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't have it, do you?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I didn't fucking know there was one! (beat) Why don't you just type in Stallions or something?<br />
 <br />
(ANDY reaches into the box)<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No! (smacks ANDY's hand away) It's not going to be that simple. They're not idiots. For starters, the pad doesn't even have letters. It's just digits.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Well let's start typing in numbers.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
That's dumb.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
You've got a better idea?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Look, why don't we just go over to Jack's house and watch a movie?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
No -<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oooo... We can watch Channel 85!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I'd rather not spend my evening watching scrambled porn. Look, we can figure this out. We've got the whole night.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
The whole night!?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah! That's what we agreed on.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
What is your problem?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I agree with Skip. Numbers and.... I don't think we're gonna be able to figure this out tonight. Let's just go to Jack's.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I'm glad everyone's inviting themselves over to my house.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Besides I'm supposed to meet up with Beth later.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No way!!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Excuse me?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You can screw around with Beth or anybody else you want the rest of the summer. Tonight is about us.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
But...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(resigned) No - this is more important.<br />

ANDY<br />

WILL<br />
No, Andy. I said no!!<br />

(to WILL) So what do you wanna do?<br />

WILL<br />
Just let me think.<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
The password has to be written down somewhere, right?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe, but how would we get that?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Well, this is the master key to the building, isn't it?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
So it'll get us into the maintenance closet. And I bet you twenty bucks the password's in there. (beat) Look, it has to be written down. Those guys can't even count to 10, how are they gonna remember a password? I mean it's worth trying!

All right! So what's the plan?<br />

 <br />
ANDY<br />
Where's he going?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
To see if he can find the password.<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
Good idea. (beat) Hey, I almost forgot. Do either of you want a beer? It's not the best stuff, but it's all I could find.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY runs over to the bleachers. He pulls a couple bottles out of his bag.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to ANDY) What kind did you get?<br />

ANDY<br />

AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY <br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY <br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME <br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST <br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW <br />
<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE <br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b42711")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b42711")' onclick='show("b42711")' id='w42711'>RIDE</span> TO POCONOS <br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED <br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE <br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
 <br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES <br />
<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE <br />
SO <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b42712")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b42712")' onclick='show("b42712")' id='w42712'>HE ASKED ME FOR</span> A RIDE<br />
 <br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS <br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT <br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT <br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY <br />
<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND <br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING <br />
WE WERE DRIVING <br />
WE WERE DRIVING <br />
JUST ME <br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY <br />
<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />

Think of it this way, you've already got three great boyfriends. And best of all we split up the duties! That way you'll never get sick of one guy. Skip gives you thought provoking conversation, I organize your day, and Andy gives it to you up the butt.<br />

Hey! (to JACK) You owe you me twenty bucks! I didn't find shit. (He hands the keys back to WILL. He raises a magazine.) But I did find this Hustler in the closet? It's a classic. Check out the banana titties on page 42. (Tosses the magazine to Jack. Silence) What?<br />

Oh. Wow. You don't need to hold that. (Takes the magazine from JACK and tosses it) So you're gay? I sort of always knew I think, no offense, you're just not very good at hiding things.<br />

(SKIP and WILL exit. ANDY and JACK are left alone. There is a long silence. ANDY takes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. JACK stares at him. ANDY offers one to JACK)<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
No... thanks.<br />

(ANDY lights a cigarette.)<br />

When did you start that?<br />

A couple months ago.<br />

Thanks.<br />

(JACK just stares at ANDY. ANDY feels the stare, and puts out the cigarette. He takes a big, deep swig of his beer, almost finishing it. JACK picks up the copy of Playboy that has been lying on the ground. He begins flipping through pages. He opens it up to the centerfold and examines it.)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Wow. She's hot.<br />

She's better then all right, I think. (He examines the picture further) Except for this.<br />

ANDY<br />
I know you don't want to talk about that.<br />

(Silence. JACK closes the magazine and tosses it back on the ground. Another long, awkward silence. ANDY opens his duffle bag and pulls out two bottles of beer.)<br />
<br />
You want one of these?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sighs) Sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
(ANDY hands a bottle to JACK. They both take a couple of sips. JACK winces at the taste.)<br />

JACK</span><br />
Remember when <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b42960")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b42960")' onclick='show("b42960")' id='w42960'>we used to steal liquor from Will's Dad's cabinet?<br />

I got in so much trouble for that too. I was grounded for like a month.<br />

"Will had been grounded for the last two weeks of his summer vacation. As he sat alone in his room, an unexpected knock came from the second story window.

Andy tried to say something but quickly lost his grip and plummeted to the ground. They all landed in a heap, laughing and hopelessly trying to untangle themselves. Will smiled. He was only 13, but he knew the idiots on his front lawn were the brothers he never had."<br />
