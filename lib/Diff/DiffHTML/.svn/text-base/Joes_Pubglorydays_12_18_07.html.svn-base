"The cabinet door had been left unlocked... big mistake. The boys stared in awe at a row of half-filled bottles glistening on the top shelf. Will had been explicitly warned against going anywhere near his father's liquor cabinet. He knew the punishment would be severe, somewhere between grounding and death, but it was a risk he was willing to take. Jack kept an eye on the door, while Skip carefully ascended each shelf and returned with a tall brown bottle. Andy tore away the gold seal and dared Will to take the first sip. Just as Will placed the bottle to his lips, he heard the sound of footsteps trudging down the hall. Jack tried to warn them but it was too late."<br />

JACK<br />
You made a point to get to know every janitor while you were in school?<br />
<br />
 <br />
(WILL walks over to the box and tries each key in the lock.)<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So let me get this straight, you broke into the girl's house!?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Not exactly. It was much deeper than that.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
They don't need to hear this.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh come on, it's a good story! I hooked her and Will up on a little dinner date. Imagine if you will... Will drives to the house. He's got on a nice shirt. He walks up, rings the doorbell, and there's Abby. And she's looking FINE. She's all ready to go out for a night on the town, but, suddenly Will decides he has to "use the bathroom." (to WILL) Tell Skip what you said.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
About what?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
To Abby!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
"May I use your bathroom?"<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
And BANG, he's in the house! So while Abby's showing him the bathroom, I'm sneaking in the front door. I hide in the closet. Will takes a fake leak, all done, they leave, I pull off some 007 shit, grab the keys, and I'm out like magic.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Andy...?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Where was her dad during all this?<br />

He works a night shift over at Grossman's.<br />

(still digging through the keys) Andy, shut up for a second! This won't open.<br />

ANDY<br />

The box, it won't open.<br />

Yeah.<br />

JACK<br />
So it'll get us into the maintenance closet. And I bet you twenty bucks the password's in there. (beat) Look, it has to be written down. Those guys can't even count to 10, how are they gonna remember a password? I mean it's worth trying! We're running out of ideas.<br />

Good idea. (beat) Hey, I almost forgot. Do either of you want a beer? It's not the best stuff, but it's all I could find.<br />

AND I GOT INTO MY CAR <br />
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT <br />
BUT I DIDN'T CARE <br />
<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY <br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST <br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN <br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO <br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES <br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS <br />
<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE <br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME <br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
 <br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS <br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY <br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY <br />
<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS <br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY <br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY <br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME <br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST <br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW <br />
<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE <br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w78546")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w78546")' onclick='show("w78546")' id='b78546'>RIDE</span> TO POCONOS <br />

I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE <br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
 <br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES <br />
<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE <br />

AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT <br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT <br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY <br />
<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND <br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING <br />
WE WERE DRIVING <br />
WE WERE DRIVING <br />
JUST ME <br />

WILL<br />
Why is this such a problem for you?<br />

 <br />
ANDY<br />
Because he lied! Because he's been lying to us for the past 8 years!<br />

WILL<br />
Jesus... this is so twisted! He didn't lie to us!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Fine, think whatever you want. I'm leaving!<br />

WILL<br />
Andy. I think if you just talk to him -<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
No Will! I don't need to do anything. This is his issue. Not mine.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No! You're the one who's making this an issue.<br />

ANDY<br />
This isn't about me!<br />

This is about you. This is all about you. You're the one who's being a fucking asshole!<br />

OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
JACK (to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS <br />
<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS <br />
LIKE WHAT I OVERHEARD <br />
YOU JUST SAY ABOUT ME<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU? <br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS <br />
WE DON'T ALL WALK AROUND <br />
<br />
SAYING WHATEVER WE WANT<br />
 <br />
CAUSE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE <br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL <br />
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE <br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
 <br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW <br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS <br />
DONT FUCK WITH EACH OTHER <br />
UNLESS THEY WANT TO LOSE EACH OTHER <br />
AND YOU JUST LOST ME<br />
 <br />
(JACK waits for ANDY to say something. ANDY remains silent.)<br />

And now you have nothing to say.<br />

You came here tonight and dropped this shit on us...and assumed that everything would be fine.<br />

ANDY<br />
There's nothing to talk about. I'm going home!<br />

(WILL grabs ANDY's arm)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(with a huge outburst) NO YOU'RE NOT! (Silence) We've been friends for 8 years. I'm not letting you throw that away just because we haven't seen each other for a few months. We can fix this. Just forget about it.<br />
 <br />
FORGET ABOUT IT<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG <br />
REMEMBER THOSE DREAMS THAT YOU LET GO OF <br />
CAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD YOU  <br />
THAT YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DREAM THE WAY YOU DO <br />
DIDN'T YOU<br />
<br />
 <br />
AND NOW EVERYTHING IS ASS BACKWARDS <br />
AND WE SEE EACH OTHER THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES <br />
EVERYTHING IS ASS BACKWARDS <br />
AND WE'RE BECOMING PEOPLE WE DESPISE <br />
SO WHY NOT TRY AND FORGET ABOUT IT?<br />
 <br />
<br />
FORGET ABOUT IT <br />
WHEN YOU SEE ALL THE INCONSISTENSIES IN THE WAY WE SEE THE WORLD <br />
FORGET ABOUT IT <br />
WHEN YOU LEARN THAT SOMEONE YEARNS TO BE DIFFERENT<br />

THINGS CAN CHANGE <br />

Sure, but you don't know everything.<br />

Okay fine, but I feel like I know something about you. I don't feel like I know anything about Andy. It's like he's a completely different person. Like something got added on or taken away. That's not the same kid I grew up with.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
And that's exactly the way he feels about you. You're not the same person either. You've changed. We all change.<br />

Thanks Socrates. Some of us change for the better. I think Andy's regressed.<br />

Look, this is gonna work itself out. I don't think he meant to say the things he did. Just give him some time to cool off, then you two can talk. He'll come around.<br />

As far as I could get on the money I had, which wasn't much. I hit like 11 states I think.<br />

SKIP<br />
Including Iowa. Wow. Why did you decide to do that?<br />

JACK<br />
I don't know. I wanted a change. There was...stuff I needed to figure out.<br />

So you dropped everything and just... left?<br />

No, it's okay.<br />

 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) It's cool.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
We got it. Let's go!<br />
 <br />
(SKIP and WILL exit. ANDY and JACK are left alone. There is a long silence. ANDY takes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. JACK stares at him. ANDY offers one to JACK)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No... thanks.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY lights a cigarette.)<br />
<br />
When did you start that?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
A couple months ago.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Why?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
It's relaxing.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
That's dumb.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Thanks.<br />
 <br />
(JACK just stares at ANDY. ANDY feels the stare, and puts out the cigarette. He takes a big, deep swig of his beer, almost finishing it. JACK picks up the copy of Playboy that has been lying on the ground. He begins flipping through pages. He opens it up to the centerfold and examines it.)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Wow. She's hot.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY stares at him. Silence.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't you think?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
She's all right.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
She's better then all right, I think. (He examines the picture further) Except for this.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Look at that bush. It's like an untouched forest down there! I can't deal with that. You gotta do a little upkeep. You know, trim away some of the hedge...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Come on.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I know you don't want to talk about that.<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK closes the magazine and tosses it back on the ground. Another long, awkward silence. ANDY opens his duffle bag and pulls out two bottles of beer.)<br />
<br />
You want one of these?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sighs) Sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
(ANDY hands a bottle to JACK. They both take a couple of sips. JACK winces at the taste.)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Remember when we used to steal liquor from Will's Dad's cabinet?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(ANDY cracks a smile) Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'll never forget that time we got caught. Mr. Henry's face will forever be etched in my mind. I'll never forget it, I thought Will was gonna get strangled.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I got in so much trouble for that too. I was grounded for like a month.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You were always grounded! You must have spent half of middle school in your room.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I know! And I did the same shit you guys did. Like when we stole that sign from the Presbyterian Church on Marengo.<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
(laughing) "God Answers Knee Mail."<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah! My mom took my car away. Wouldn't let me go out for three weeks. You guys weren't even punished!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I had to spend winter break doing inventory at my dad's store.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Whoop-de-fucking-do! I had to baby sit Samantha every day!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
She's so cute though.<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
She's Satan.<br />

JACK<br />
She's your sister!<br />

ANDY<br />
She's a bitch!<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
She's six!<br />

<br />
So... who's Beth?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm sorry?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Beth?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh, just a girl I've been...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Ah hah. How long?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
A few weeks.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
How'd you meet?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
At the pool.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
And she lives around here?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah. She went to Roosevelt.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Oh. So you spotted her across the deep end and it was love at first sight?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Not quite.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
What's she like?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
She's nice.<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Wow, you must really think a lot of her.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
What do you want? She's cool, smart. Wants to teach elementary school. Like first graders. (long pause) And she's hot.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
THAT's what I was waiting for!<br />

WILL<br />

JACK<br />

I don't know. This is a pretty big moment. I don't want to jump right into it. (looks at SKIP) Skip?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Don't look at me. I don't know what to say.<br />

ANDY<br />
I got it! It's been fun - let's get this shit done! (Proud of his rhyming abilities, he sticks his hand in the box.)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(Smacking Andy's hand out of the way) No - that sucked!<br />

 <br />
ANDY<br />
Then you say it!<br />

WILL<br />
Fine - I will! (silence) So, here we are... our 2nd annual prank. (silence)<br />

ANDY<br />
Wow! No you're right, yours was much better.<br />

JACK<br />

ANDY<br />
Like a sign. You know like when Zorro does that Z thing.<br />

<br />
<br />
TURN AROUND<br />
 <br />
 WILL<br />
FOR SOME REASON "THREE" SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT EMPTY <br />
FOR SOME REASON "FOUR" HAD A NICER RING <br />
FOR SOME REASON WE COULDN'T HOLD ON TO EACH OTHER <br />
BECAUSE OF OUR DIFFERENCES IN THINGS<br />
<br />
<br />
FOR SOME REASON I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY OVER <br />
FOR SOME REASON THIS ENDING SEEMS TOO CLEAN <br />
FOR SOME REASON, WE EVER MET IN THE FIRST PLACE <br />
AND I THINK THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN<br />
<br />
WE USED TO SNEAK OUT LATE <br />
TO STAND WHERE I AM NOW <br />
<br />
LIKE WE'D NEVER GO AWAY<br />
<br />
LITTLE DID I KNOW <br />
I'D BE BACK OUT HERE NOW <br />
IN SUCH A DIFFERENT PLACE <br />
JUST AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY<br />
<br />
TURN AROUND <br />
<br />
FACE THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT <br />
BUT TURN AROUND <br />
TURN AROUND AND YOU JUST MIGHT BE FOUND<br />
<br />
TURN AROUND  <br />
TURN AWAY AND TRY TO SAY THAT IT'S OKAY <br />
TO TURN AROUND <br />
<br />
TURN AROUND AND YOU JUST MIGHT BE FOUND<br />
<br />
(WILL opens up his notebook and reads.)<br />
<br />
"Will had been grounded for the last two weeks of his summer vacation. As he sat alone in his room, an unexpected knock came from the second story window. He turned around to see Andy's smiling face hovering outside. Will looked down to see Skip and Jack struggling to support Andy's legs. Andy tried to say something but quickly lost his grip and plummeted to the ground. They all landed in a heap, laughing and hopelessly trying to untangle themselves. Will smiled. He was only 13, but he knew the idiots on his front lawn were the brothers he never had."<br />
<br />
THIS WILL ALWAYS BE HOME <br />
WHERE WE DREAMED UNDER THESE SAME STARS <br />
WE CAN ALWAYS COME HOME <br />

THAT ONLY SEEM TO SHOW<br />

THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />

JACK<br />
Okay...<br />
<br />
<br />
THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL<br />
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP<br />
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You kissed your Mom <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b78544")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b78544")' onclick='show("b78544")' id='w78544'>Dude</span>? Gross...  <br />

        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR<br />
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT<br />
BUT I DIDN'T CARE<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b78546")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b78546")' onclick='show("b78546")' id='w78546'>RIDGE</span> TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
<br />
SO <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b78547")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b78547")' onclick='show("b78547")' id='w78547'>I OFFERED HIM</span> A RIDE<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />

Never! My roommate was like that. He wore plaid shorts every day of the week. It'd be 15 degrees outside and he'd still be wearing  shorts and boat shoes. Dumbass.<br />

Jesus. I got a check from my grandma that bounced.<br />

And the worst part about it is he thinks he's entitled to those things. Like he's owed something for doing nothing. Whatever. It's not worth wasting breath over. <br />

WILL<br />
Did that come with the hair too?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What?<br />

SKIP<br />
Exactly! Hence, the "whatever." <br />

WILL<br />
Since when have you ever backed down from a character debate?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Since I saw how pointless they are. Look, I can bitch and moan all I want about him... about anything... but ultimately it doesn't do shit. It's just one opinion. <br />

WILL<br />
What?! This coming from the most opinionated guy I know.<br />

JACK<br />

What about Ghandi?<br />

SKIP<br />
(confused) What about Ghandi?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Think about all the shit he did. That was just one dude!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, but Ghandi didn't live in an age of iPods and On Demand. People would rather sit on their asses and wait for someone else to do what they'd rather not do themselves, just because they can. My roommate isn't any different. So why should I be?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Because you are. You always have been. It's why we're friends.<br />

 I thought</span> we were <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b78607")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b78607")' onclick='show("b78607")' id='w78607'>friends because we sucked at football.<br />

Yes! All that.<br />

FROM A SUPERPOWER INTO A GHOST <br />

OUR FATHERS ARE COMMUTERS, BUT WE'RE STUCK IN OUR COMPUTERS <br />
 WHICH TAKE US ALL AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER, BUT WHO CARES<br />
SO WE'RE TOO OCCUPIED TO NOTICE WHAT WAS THERE HAS DIED <br />
BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WHO USED TO LOVE EACH OTHER, CUZ WHO CARES<br />
THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD WE'RE IN WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT HERE<br />

There's that window in the gym. I used to sneak out of it during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />

Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />

JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />

WILL<br />
<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
About what? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You know. I mean, was it something that you've always known or...<br />
 64<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, long beat)<br />
<br />
    Does it bother you?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question, you know?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
 65<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or something. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN   <br />
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
 66<br />
        <br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />

JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 67<br />
        <br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away.  Silence.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What was that for?<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />

ANDY<br />

What are you doing?<br />

Shit. <br />

WILL<br />
No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.<br />

SKIP<br />
<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything about it, cause I didn't want him to fuck anything up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing?  Something you wanna tell me?<br />

No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.<br />

Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, maybe not. <br />

SKIP<br />
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />

MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS</span> OF MYSELF I <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b78729")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b78729")' onclick='show("b78729")' id='w78729'>HATE TO BE<br />

 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />

LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
 81<br />
        <br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />

(throws the key into the distance)<br />

I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />

RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
