GLORY DAYS<br />
 A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
 Book by James Gardiner<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
 LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench.)<br />
<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w56839")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w56839")' onclick='show("w56839")' id='b56839'></span>THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
  <br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
  <br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />
 Page 1<br />
        <br />
<br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
<br />
 THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
 BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
 JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w56840")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w56840")' onclick='show("w56840")' id='b56840'>pulls his notebook out</span> of his <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w56841")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w56841")' onclick='show("w56841")' id='b56841'>backpack</span>)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
 AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
<br />
YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
 <br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

ANDY<br />

 Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
  He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?<br />

No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally together in the same place. Isn't that enough? <br />

No, I think it's more that you don't get it.<br />

ANDY<br />
Oh I get it.<br />

SKIP<br />
No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you've acquired. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />

But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other." <br />

(SKIP and ANDY exit, whooping and hollering. WILL and JACK are left alone.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 SSShhhhhhhhhhhhh! Guys!<br />
<br />
Page 63<br />
        <br />
JACK<br />
 They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence) <br />
<br />
<br />
So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 No. There isn't. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Who?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Kissed?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
<br />
 <br />
Page 64<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
 (laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Yea. How long have you known? <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w56964")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w56964")' onclick='show("w56964")' id='b56964'></span>I mean, was it something that you <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w56965")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w56965")' onclick='show("w56965")' id='b56965'></span>always <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w56966")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w56966")' onclick='show("w56966")' id='b56966'>knew</span> or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 (wryly) Why so curious?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Well... I think part of me has always known and I <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w56967")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w56967")' onclick='show("w56967")' id='b56967'></span>just pushed it away. I'd <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w56968")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w56968")' onclick='show("w56968")' id='b56968'>keep</span> telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w56969")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w56969")' onclick='show("w56969")' id='b56969'></span>beat)<br />
<br />
<br />
Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 No, of course not. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 (caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
 <br />
 Page 65<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 (beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 What'd he say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 ...Yeah.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
 <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
   THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
<br />
  SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
  <br />
Page 66<br />
        <br />
  IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
  <br />
<br />
  WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
  THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 MAYBE<br />
  THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
  IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
  THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
  MAYBE<br />
  THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
  JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
  SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
  AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
  HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
  WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
  THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
  WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
 IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
<br />
 CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
  <br />
Page 67<br />
<br />
        <br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
  THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 ANDY<br />
  THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
  IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 ANDY<br />
  THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
  IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
 I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
<br />
  THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away. Silence.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 What was that for?<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
 What are you doing?<br />

(JACK and WILL pull away from each other)<br />

JACK<br />
 Shit. <br />

 THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
  YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
  THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
  CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
<br />
 BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
  I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />

(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
 SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
  THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
  DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
<br />
   WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />

  WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />

 YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
  WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL<br />

  THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
  DONT FUCK WITH OTHER<br />
  UNLESS THEY WANT TO LOSE EACH OTHER<br />
  WELL, YOU JUST LOST ME<br />

 YOU DON'T CARE HOW I FEEL<br />

LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
 INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
 CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
 <br />
Page 81<br />
        <br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
<br />
 IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
  AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
 BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />

<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />

A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />

 <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b56839")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b56839")' onclick='show("b56839")' id='w56839'>He opens his notebook and begins to read</span>)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />
Page 1<br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />

<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />

JACK<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />

ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />

JACK<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?  <br />

He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted. <br />

Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own.<br />

But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />

Keep reading!<br />

Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." <br />

WILL<br />
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please. <br />

<br />
WILL<br />
(glares at SKIP) It's Will! Hi. I'm fine. Listen, I'm calling because there seems to have been a bit of a mix up. The key that you gave me doesn't work. Yeah, nope.  So I was just wondering if there was any possibility - (beat) Oh, really!? No, that would be amazing! Thank you. (beat) Uh... Friday?<br />
<br />
<br />

ANDY<br />
(giving it to Friday and hard) Oh yeah, Friday!<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />

<br />
WILL<br />
(looking to the guys for help) I just -I got in a car accident yesterday, so... I'm injured. Injured bad. <br />
<br />

<br />
Yea I'll be okay, just broke a few bones. Sure. Yeah just give me a call back okay. Great! Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What was that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cover. <br />
<br />
JACK <br />
What'd she say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
She's babysitting right now, so she's going to look and see what she can find. She said she'd call me back.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
So we're just waiting?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I guess so.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Dammit.<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I feel like we should have brought a board game or something. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Like Jenga!?<br />
<br />
<br />
Page 31<br />
WILL<br />
Jenga's not a board game!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I was thinking more along the lines of like Monopoly.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I hate Monopoly.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You would.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is that supposed to mean?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You're just not a Monopoly kinda guy. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Yea, cuz I hate it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, I think it's more that you don't get it.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh I get it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you've acquired. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Thank you for admitting it.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
My roommate started a board game club in our dorm room this year. Didn't even ask.<br />

WILL<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Did he get kicked out?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No...<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Cause this kid on our floor got kicked out for smoking weed in his room. (to WILL) Remember Stevey?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Smart kid too ... he tried to create this like ventilation system out his window so the RA couldn't smell it. But somebody saw the smoke outside and called the fire department. Now he goes to community college. Fuckin' sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to JACK) What happened to him?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Your roommate... The Clue Meister.<br />
<br />

JACK<br />
Nothing.<br />

WILL<br />
Then why did you only put up with him for a little while?<br />
<br />
Page 33<br />
JACK<br />
I didn't see him as much.<br />

WILL<br />

JACK<br />

WILL<br />

I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />
<br />
<br />
Page 35<br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />

What'd he say?<br />

WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />

JACK<br />
He said that?<br />

...Yeah.<br />

Should I talk to him?<br />

NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />

No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />

<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />

 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />

CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />

THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />

WILL<br />
<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />

BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />

BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />

(ANDY picks up the notebook up off the bleachers)<br />
<br />
AND ALL OF THESE MEMORIES WE USED TO ENJOY<br />
THE NIGHTS OUT HERE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE<br />
THE BROTHERS THAT NO ONE COULD EVER DESTROY<br />
WERE WORTH NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING!!<br />
<br />
(ANDY tears the notebook apart.)<br />

NOW IT IS MY TURN TO ASK YOU <br />
WHAT TO DO?<br />
WHEN AFTER FIVE YEARS<br />
I DON'T TRUST YOU<br />
WE'VE BEEN BROTHERS FOR SO LONG<br />
AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE - <br />
<br />
<br />
SO IT IS MY TURN -<br />
<br />
IT IS MY TURN<br />
TO GO<br />
BUT IT IS YOUR TURN<br />
TO KNOW <br />
I'VE NEVER HAD A GIFT LIKE YOURS FOR CLEVER WORDS TO SAY<br />

Andy -<br />
(WILL, near tears, is on the ground, trying to piece together his journal)<br />
<br />
What was he talking about? You lied to him?<br />
PAGE 77<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything, cause I didn't want anything to get fucked up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing anyways?  Something you wanna tell me?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know.<br />
<br />
(WILL continues to pick up the pieces of the notebook)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.<br />
<br />
(SKIP kneels down to help)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, maybe not. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know, but when the hell did that happen?<br />
<br />
Page 78<br />
SKIP<br />
Good question.<br />
<br />
BOYS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
WHEN WE WERE BOYS<br />
WE HAD FUN<br />
AND BLAMED MISTAKES ON BEING HUMAN<br />
<br />
BUT NOW WE'RE OLD<br />
AND EVEN ONE<br />
WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN<br />
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND<br />
<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT ALL OF US DID<br />
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER WE WERE SO SURE<br />
THAT WE'D NEVER STOP BEING BOYS ANYMORE<br />

ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID<br />
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE<br />

BUT DOES THAT MEAN WE CANT BE BOYS ANYMORE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING<br />
<br />
Page 79<br />
<br />
THAT I COULD BE LOSING YOU<br />

SKIP<br />
NOBODY IS LOSING<br />
<br />
EVERYONE'S JUST GROWING TOO<br />

WILL<br />
WHAT IF THIS WAS NEVER RIGHT<br />
AND IT TOOK US UP UNTIL TONIGHT <br />
TO REALIZE WE'D BEEN SAVING FACE<br />
AND ADMIT WE ARE OUT OF PLACE<br />

SKIP<br />
DON'T FIGHT TO FIGURE OUT<br />
<br />
SOMETHING WE'LL ALL JUST LAUGH ABOUT<br />

ONE DAY<br />

WILL<br />
I AM NOT READY TO STOP BEING A KID<br />

WILL and SKIP<br />
WE'LL NEVER BE WHO WE WERE BEFORE<br />

SKIP<br />
BUT NEVER SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BOYS...<br />

WILL and SKIP<br />
(tradeoff)<br />
<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
<br />
(A long silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
God I hate this place. Why couldn't we have gone to Andy's and watched Ella Enchanted? (beat) I'm gonna go.  You want a ride?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, that's okay.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You sure?<br />

WILL<br />
<br />
Yeah...I think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
All right. We're gonna be okay. I promise.<br />
<br />
(SKIP starts to exit.)<br />
<br />
Oh I almost forgot.<br />
<br />
(SKIP pulls a key out of his pocket and tosses it to WILL)<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You found it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />

SKIP<br />

I know. I love you too.<br />

<br />
MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
<br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
  <br />
  Page 81<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />
<br />
Page 82<br />
CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />

(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)<br />
