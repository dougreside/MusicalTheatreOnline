GLORY DAYS<br />
A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />
<br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37718")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37718")' onclick='show("w37718")' id='b37718'>He opens his notebook and begins to read</span>)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />
Page 1<br />
<br />
    SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37719")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37719")' onclick='show("w37719")' id='b37719'>begins flipping through the pages</span> of his <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37720")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37720")' onclick='show("w37720")' id='b37720'>notebook</span>)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
<br />
 <br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

 I hate you. (beat) Is it something -?<br />

       <br />
WILL <br />
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS<br />
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO<br />
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO<br />
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU<br />
<br />
(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.)<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?  <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Superman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

<br />
WILL <br />
<br />
(to JACK) ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST YEAR!<br />

I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN <br />
TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN<br />
    <br />
    Page 6<br />
<br />
BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT <br />
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What's your point?<br />

WILL<br />

JACK<br />
Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I said I was sorry!  I'm sorry! <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL runs over to his backpack)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Slobbers? What was he doing?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted. <br />

That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me? <br />

ANDY<br />
I'm gonna punch you in the face - <br />

Hey now, there's no need to get all huffy...it's not my fault your sister's bangin'! <br />

Hey, whatever floats your boat, right? <br />

ANDY<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />

(<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37730")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37730")' onclick='show("w37730")' id='b37730'>sarcastic</span>) A piece of paper.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?<br />

WILL<br />
Just read!<br />

WILL<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Keep reading!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." <br />

No shit!? <br />

Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that...

WILL<br />
Wait...you've been home for three weeks? Why didn't you call us? (referencing ANDY too) We've been here.  <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I know. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I thought you were still at school. Did you not want us to know you were back?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37832")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37832")' onclick='show("w37832")' id='b37832'>Will</span>, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just needed some time alone.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Well, I don't care, I wanna know everything! Where'd you go? What'd you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Everything?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay...<br />
<br />
<br />
THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL<br />
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP<br />
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You kissed your Mom Dude? Gross...  <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR<br />
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT<br />
BUT I DIDN'T CARE<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />
<br />
Page 35<br />
<br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />
<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />

How many kids do you think have graduated from this place?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So many.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
That's not a number, Jack.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(WILL sits up) Seriously though, how many kids have filed in and out of this building over the years, like it was a goddamn assembly line. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37879")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37879")' onclick='show("w37879")' id='b37879'>Think about all those kids that graduated in our class that we never even knew.

JACK<br />
Fahid?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah him!  He'll forever be known as the kid you never wanted to follow behind during the rope climb. And that's probably all we'll ever know him as.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
He also borrowed my pen during Calculus and never gave it back. I'll never forget that. <br />

No really! (beat</span>) Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! (Points to where Andy is sitting)<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who they are. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...and even then there are probably thousands of Chris' and Amanda's. <br />

I haven't thought about that in so long. <br />

Yea, why did you lie about that? You knew we were gonna find out when we got our drivers' licenses.<br />

You had me for a while though, I totally bought the "my mom wants me to wait until she thinks I'm ready."<br />

I remember the day we caught you too. We were at Andy's house and your mom was like... (laughs) "It's gonna be so nice of you boys to drive Willy around until he TURNS 16." WHAAAAAAAAAT? <br />

<br />
(Everyone laughs)<br />

WILL<br />
Listen jerks! Everything was going great, I didn't want the fact that we were different ages to mess anything up.<br />

You're OCD. <br />

ANDY<br />
It doesn't matter if our ages are symmetrical.<br />

SKIP<br />
Don't you mean identical?<br />

ANDY<br />
No. I meant what I said.<br />

JACK<br />
You should be proud. You skipped Kindergarten! That means you're smarter than us.<br />

SKIP<br />
Yeah, who skips Kindergarten? Of all grades. "Oh, young William? He plays with blocks better than the other kids. Bump him</span>!"<br />

ANDY<br />
What? <br />

WILL<br />
(into the phone) Don't worry about it. No no it's okay. <br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
What did she say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Thanks anyway. (beat)  Umm... yeah I'm actually busy Thursday night too so.... Uh-huh. Yeah that's a bad night too. Remember- broken bones. I got broken bones. Okay well gotta run, but I'll talk to you later. Okay. Great! Bye. (hangs up the phone) Jesus.<br />

JACK<br />
(to WILL) What's wrong?<br />

WILL<br />
That girl does not give up.<br />

No, what's up with the key!?<br />

WILL<br />
Well... she says it's in the building.  <br />

ANDY<br />
What!?<br />

WILL<br />
Apparently it may be in the maintenance closet. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
So what did she give us?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
She doesn't know, but now she's pretty sure it's in there. <br />

Well... there's that window in the gym. The one we used to sneak out of during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />

No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />

Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />

Probably.<br />

(Long silence) <br />

    So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />

JACK<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />

Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />

WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />

JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />

WILL<br />
Why not?<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />

WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />

JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />

<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I'<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37893")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37893")' onclick='show("w37893")' id='b37893'>ve never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before.

I think <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37896")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37896")' onclick='show("w37896")' id='b37896'>part of me has</span> always <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37897")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37897")' onclick='show("w37897")' id='b37897'>known... And I kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet</span> some <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37898")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37898")' onclick='show("w37898")' id='b37898'>girl and everything will change.

<br />
    Does that bother you?<br />

WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />

<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
        <br />
        Page 65<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
    <br />
    Page 66<br />
<br />
    IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />

JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />

IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />

WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />

<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />

THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />

THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />

MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
  <br />
  Page 81<br />
<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
    AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY    <br />
    <br />
    Page 82<br />
<br />
    CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />

<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />

WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
<br />
RIGHT HERE<br />

WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />

<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
<br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
<br />

        <br />

CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write)<br />
<br />
YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />

BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO <br />

No, I think it's more that you don't get it.<br />

ANDY<br />
Oh I get it.<br />

SKIP<br />
<br />
No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you've acquired. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />

AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />

ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />

AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />

AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />

But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other." <br />

(WILL sits up) Seriously though, how many kids have filed in and out of this building over the years, like it was a goddamn assembly line. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37879")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37879")' onclick='show("b37879")' id='w37879'></span>I mean, how many kids do you think have sat out on these bleachers<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37880")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37880")' onclick='show("b37880")' id='w37880'></span>? Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! (Points to where Andy is sitting)<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." <br />
    <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who they are. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...and even then there are probably thousands of Chris' and Amanda's. <br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
I bet Amanda's hot. Just saying.<br />

WILL<br />
(into the phone) Don't worry about it. No no it's okay.<br />

ANDY<br />
What did she say?<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Thanks anyway. (beat)  Umm... yeah I'm actually busy Thursday night too so.... Uh-huh. Yeah that's a bad night too. Remember- broken bones. I got broken bones. Okay well gotta run, but I'll talk to you later. Okay. Great! Bye. (hangs up the phone) Jesus.<br />

JACK<br />
(to WILL) What's wrong?<br />

WILL<br />
That girl does not give up.<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
No, what's up with the key!?<br />

WILL<br />
Well... she says it's in the building.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
What!?<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Apparently it may be in the maintenance closet.<br />
    <br />
JACK<br />
So what did she give us?<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
She doesn't know, but now she's pretty sure it's in there.<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
(sarcastic) Well that's great, we probably have his car keys. What are we supposed to do now?<br />

Well... there's that window in the gym. The one we used to sneak out of during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />

They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />

No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />

Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />

WILL<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence)<br />

So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />

JACK<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />

Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />

No. There isn't. <br />

Kissed?<br />

WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />

JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />

WILL<br />
Why not?<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />

        <br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />

JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />

Yea.

I dunno, I just - I <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37893")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37893")' onclick='show("b37893")' id='w37893'>mean</span>, I<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37894")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37894")' onclick='show("b37894")' id='w37894'></span> wanna know what it's like. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37895")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37895")' onclick='show("b37895")' id='w37895'></span>What you're going through.<br />

<br />
Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
<br />
Page 65<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
<br />
Page 66<br />
        <br />
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
<br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />

Page 67<br />
        <br />

JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />

No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything, cause I didn't want anything to get fucked up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing anyways?  Something you wanna tell me?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know.<br />
(WILL continues to pick up the pieces of the notebook)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.<br />
<br />
(SKIP kneels down to help)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, maybe not.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know, but when the hell did that happen?<br />
<br />

        <br />
SKIP<br />
Good question.<br />
<br />
BOYS<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN WE WERE BOYS<br />
WE HAD FUN<br />
AND BLAMED MISTAKES ON BEING HUMAN<br />
<br />
BUT NOW WE'RE OLD<br />
AND EVEN ONE<br />
WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN<br />
<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN<br />
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT ALL OF US DID<br />
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER WE WERE SO SURE<br />
THAT WE'D NEVER STOP BEING BOYS ANYMORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU THINK IS DEAD<br />
<br />
YOU'RE <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37941")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37941")' onclick='show("b37941")' id='w37941'>WHINING</span> LIKE YOUR LIFE IS OVER<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT FEELS THAT WAY<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT NO ONE SAID<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37942")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37942")' onclick='show("b37942")' id='w37942'>YOU</span> CANT SCREW UP WHEN <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37943")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37943")' onclick='show("b37943")' id='w37943'>YOU</span> GET OLDER<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
WE WERE SO PERFECT TIL TODAY<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37944")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37944")' onclick='show("b37944")' id='w37944'>ANDY'S</span> RIGHT<br />
THE GOOD OLD DAYS<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
NEVER STAY<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
<br />
MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID<br />
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE<br />
BUT DOES THAT MEAN WE CANT BE BOYS ANYMORE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING<br />
<br />
Page 79<br />
        <br />
THAT I COULD BE LOSING YOU<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
NOBODY IS LOSING<br />
EVERYONE'S JUST GROWING TOO<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHAT IF THIS WAS NEVER RIGHT<br />
AND IT TOOK US UP UNTIL TONIGHT <br />
TO REALIZE WE'D BEEN SAVING FACE<br />
AND ADMIT WE ARE OUT OF PLACE<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
DON'T FIGHT TO FIGURE OUT<br />
SOMETHING WE'LL ALL JUST LAUGH ABOUT<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I AM NOT READY TO STOP BEING A KID<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
WELL NOBODY SAID THAT WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
WE'LL NEVER BE WHO WE WERE BEFORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT NEVER SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BOYS...<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
(tradeoff)<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
    <br />
(A long silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
God I hate this place. Why couldn't we have gone to Andy's and watched Ella Enchanted? (beat) I'm gonna go.  You want a ride?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, that's okay.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You sure?<br />
<br />
Page 80<br />
<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah... I think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
All right. We're gonna be okay. I promise.<br />
<br />
(SKIP starts to exit.)<br />
<br />
Oh I almost forgot.<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP pulls a key out of his pocket and tosses it to WILL)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You found it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(smiles) Thanks.<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Hey. I love you, ok?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I know. I love you too.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Night buddy.<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
 Night man.<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP exits.)<br />
<br />
MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
<br />
Page 81<br />
        <br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
<br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />
<br />
Page 82<br />
        <br />
CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)<br />
<br />
<br />
THE END.<br />
<br />
GLORY DAYS<br />
