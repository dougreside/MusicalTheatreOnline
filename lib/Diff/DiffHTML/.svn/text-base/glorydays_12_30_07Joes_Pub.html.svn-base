Okay! (reading) "Come one, come all to the Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." What!? The FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! <br />

WILL<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own. <br />

ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />

<br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w50471")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w50471")' onclick='show("w50471")' id='b50471'>RIDGE</span> TO POCONOS<br />

I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w50472")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w50472")' onclick='show("w50472")' id='b50472'>I OFFERED HIM</span> A RIDE<br />

AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />

AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />

Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />

Probably.<br />

(Long silence) <br />

Sure. You can call it that. <br />

Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />

No. There isn't. <br />

Kissed?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />

JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />

WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
        <br />
        Page 64<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
About what? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You know. I mean, was it something that you always knew or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And I kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, long beat)<br />
<br />
    Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
        <br />
        Page 65<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />

THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />

WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />

JACK AND WILL<br />

THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />

JACK<br />
(to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
    <br />
    73<br />
<br />
    CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

Oh come on, it's a good story! I hooked her and Will up on a little dinner date. Imagine if you will... Will drives to the house. He's got on a nice shirt. He walks up, rings the doorbell, and there's Abby. And she's looking FINE. She's all ready to go out for a night on the town, but, suddenly Will decides he has to "use the bathroom." (to WILL) Tell Skip what you said.<br />

About what?<br />

ANDY<br />
To Abby!<br />

"May I use your bathroom?"<br />

And BANG, he's in the house! So while Abby's showing him the bathroom, I'm sneaking in the front door. I hide in the closet. Will takes a fake leak, all done, they leave, I pull off some 007 shit, grab the keys, and I'm out like magic.<br />

Right. Okay. It's set to go off at... 1:30 tonight.<br />

Graduation starts at 2:00 tomorrow.<br />

So we'll set it for 2:30! Sound good?<br />

It's got a password.<br />

No it doesn't!<br />

Yes, Andy, it clearly does.<br />

ANDY<br />
Where?<br />

WILL<br />
There, where it says "password."<br />

(ANDY stares at the screen. Silence)<br />

You don't have it, do you?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I didn't fucking know there was one! (beat) Why don't you just type in Stallions or something?<br />
 <br />
(ANDY reaches into the box)<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No! (smacks ANDY's hand away) It's not going to be that simple. They're not idiots. For starters, the pad doesn't even have letters. It's just digits.<br />

ANDY<br />
Well let's start typing in numbers.<br />

SKIP<br />
<br />
That's dumb.<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
No -<br />

ANDY<br />
Oooo... We can watch Channel 85!<br />

WILL<br />
I'd rather not spend my evening watching scrambled porn. Look, we can figure this out. We've got the whole night.<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
The whole night!?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah! That's what we agreed on.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
What is your problem?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I agree with Skip. Numbers and.... I don't think we're gonna be able to figure this out tonight. Let's just go to Jack's.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I'm glad everyone's inviting themselves over to my house.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Besides I'm supposed to meet up with Beth later.<br />

WILL<br />
No way!!<br />

ANDY<br />
Excuse me?<br />

You can screw around with Beth or anybody else you want the rest of the summer. Tonight is about us.<br />

The password has to be written down somewhere, right?<br />

Maybe, but how would we get that?<br />

Well, this is the master key to the building, isn't it?<br />

WILL<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
So it'll get us into the maintenance closet. And I bet you twenty bucks the password's in there. (beat) Look, it has to be written down.

ANDY<br />
Where's he going?<br />

WILL<br />
To see if he can find the password.<br />

ANDY<br />

Good idea. (beat) Hey, I almost forgot. Do either of you want a beer? It's not the best stuff, but it's all I could find.<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
Okay...<br />
<br />
THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL <br />
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP <br />
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
You kissed your Mom? <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b50469")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b50469")' onclick='show("b50469")' id='w50469'></span>Gross...<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR <br />
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT <br />
BUT I DIDN'T CARE <br />
<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY <br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b50470")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b50470")' onclick='show("b50470")' id='w50470'></span>AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST <br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN <br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO <br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES <br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS <br />
<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE <br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME <br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
 <br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS <br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY <br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY <br />
<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS <br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY <br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY <br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME <br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST <br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW <br />
<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE <br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b50471")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b50471")' onclick='show("b50471")' id='w50471'>RIDE</span> TO POCONOS <br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED <br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE <br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
 <br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES <br />
<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE <br />
SO <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b50472")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b50472")' onclick='show("b50472")' id='w50472'>HE ASKED ME FOR</span> A RIDE<br />
 <br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS <br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT <br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT <br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY <br />
<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND <br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING <br />
WE WERE DRIVING <br />
WE WERE DRIVING <br />
JUST ME <br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY <br />
<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
 <br />

Think of it this way, you've already got three great boyfriends. And best of all we split up the duties! That way you'll never get sick of one guy. Skip gives you thought provoking conversation, I organize your day, and Andy gives it to you up the butt.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Stop.<br />

Hey! (to JACK) You owe you me twenty bucks! I didn't find shit. (He hands the keys back to WILL. He raises a magazine.) But I did find this Hustler in the closet? It's a classic. Check out the banana titties on page 42. (Tosses the magazine to Jack. Silence) What?<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I'm gay.<br />

(He starts to laugh, but realizes that it's not a joke) Really?<br />

Yeah, I just - you missed it.<br />

Oh. Wow. You don't need to hold that. (Takes the magazine from JACK and tosses it) So you're gay? I sort of always knew I think, no offense, you're just not very good at hiding things.<br />

JACK (to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS <br />

YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS <br />
LIKE WHAT I OVERHEARD <br />
YOU JUST SAY ABOUT ME<br />

BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU? <br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS <br />
WE DON'T ALL WALK AROUND <br />
<br />
SAYING WHATEVER WE WANT<br />
 <br />
CAUSE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE <br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL <br />
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE <br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />

SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW <br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS <br />
DONT FUCK WITH EACH OTHER <br />
UNLESS THEY WANT TO LOSE EACH OTHER <br />

(SKIP and WILL exit. ANDY and JACK are left alone. There is a long silence. ANDY takes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. JACK stares at him. ANDY offers one to JACK)<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
No... thanks.<br />

When did you start that?<br />

(JACK just stares at ANDY. ANDY feels the stare, and puts out the cigarette. He takes a big, deep swig of his beer, almost finishing it. JACK picks up the copy of Playboy that has been lying on the ground. He begins flipping through pages. He opens it up to the centerfold and examines it.)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Wow. She's hot.<br />

ANDY<br />
I know you don't want to talk about that.<br />

(Silence. JACK closes the magazine and tosses it back on the ground. Another long, awkward silence. ANDY opens his duffle bag and pulls out two bottles of beer.)<br />
<br />
You want one of these?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sighs) Sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
(ANDY hands a bottle to JACK. They both take a couple of sips. JACK winces at the taste.)<br />
<br />
JACK</span><br />
Remember when <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b50716")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b50716")' onclick='show("b50716")' id='w50716'>we used to steal liquor from Will's Dad's cabinet?<br />

I got in so much trouble for that too. I was grounded for like a month.<br />
