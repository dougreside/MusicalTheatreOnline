GLORY DAYS<br />
A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />
<br />
   <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w44792")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w44792")' onclick='show("w44792")' id='b44792'>IMAGINE</span> WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />
Page 1<br />
    <br />
    SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL begins flipping through the pages of his notebook)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

    <br />
 SKIP<br />
Who're you talking to...? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(startled) Skip!! Heyyy!!<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />

<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's so good to see you.<br />

SKIP<br />
You too. (beat) Where are the other fools? I thought you said midnight.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
You like? I'm just letting nature do its thing. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(amused) You look like a girl.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, you wanna start already? Cause we can go Tubs Tubs!<br />

WILL<br />

<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What are we doing?  <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I can't tell you that. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Why not? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(coyly) Cause... I don't know if I trust you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Just tell me!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Not yet!<br />
<br />
WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT<br />

FINE. DO YOU LIKE WATER RIDES?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Are we going to Sea World? <br />

WILL<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Really?!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />

Nope. But close.<br />

CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO<br />
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU<br />
<br />
(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.) <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?  <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Superman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

    ANDY<br />
<br />
        What's up Skillet!?<br />
    <br />
(WILL and JACK hug and continue their own conversation)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(sees SKIP) Hey, who's the hippie?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Yeah, nice to see you too.<br />
<br />
(ANDY hugs SKIP. Without missing a beat, ANDY tries to get SKIP's opinion on the whole Batman vs. Superman debate.)  <br />
<br />
WILL <br />
(to JACK) ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST YEAR!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(looking around)I GOTTA SAY IT'S PRETTY WEIRD <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
HOW WAS LIFE AT SCHOOL?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
PROBABLY THE SAME AS YOU<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S TRUE UNLESS YOU ROOMED WITH ANDY TOO.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to ANDY) Drop it - <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU THINK THAT BATMAN<br />
WOULD LOSE A BATTLE TO A GUY IN TIGHTS? <br />
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE GAY RED UNDIES <br />
HE WEARS OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN <br />
<br />
TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN<br />
    <br />
    Page 6<br />
<br />
BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT <br />
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
What's your point?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sooo... ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I said I was sorry! I'm sorry! <br />
<br />
(WILL runs over to his backpack)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Slobbers? What was he doing?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I was not! <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I was not! <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Slobbering all over the sofa. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Whatever man! My sister was watching it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh yeaaah, how's she doing? <br />
<br />
(JACK laughs)<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(to SKIP) <br />
Don't start man -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What!? I'm genuinely interested!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(suspicious) She's fine. <br />
    <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm gonna punch you in the face - <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Hey now, there's no need to get all huffy...it's not my fault your sister's bangin'!<br />
<br />
<br />
    ANDY<br />
She's twelve years old!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Hey, whatever floats your boat, right?<br />
    <br />
    Page 8<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
    (to JACK)My sister is not allowed to float anyone's boat!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Aww, you're no fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
But your sister is!<br />
<br />
SKIP and JACK<br />
OHHHHHHH!!(raspberry<br />
<br />
(SKIP and JACK slap high five)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(grabbing at SKIP and JACK)Come here!<br />
<br />
    <br />
(ANDY chases SKIP and JACK around the field)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What? Take it as a compliment. You've got good genes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I swear to God-<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY!<br />
<br />
(WILL throws his arms around ANDY to hold him back. Andy continues to struggle) <br />
<br />
(to ANDY)Chill! Look, we've got important business to take care of - <br />
<br />
    (ANDY stops struggling and WILL releases him.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I got you later!  <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh yeah?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, I do!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 (scolding) Okay, enough! Here. Read.<br />

(WILL hands ANDY a newspaper clipping)<br />
<br />
    Page 9<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sarcastic) A piece of paper.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Just read!<br />
<br />
(ANDY takes a look at the paper. Clears his throat and reads)<br />

<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Keep reading!<br />

WILL<br />
This, my friend, is inspiration.<br />

SKIP<br />
<br />
Oh Jesus.... (i.e. "here we go again...")<br />
<br />
(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please.<br />

Matt Hoffman, Chris Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - <br />

JACK<br />
No shit!? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle. You see that box?<br />
<br />
(WILL points to a small weather box situated near the players bench)<br />
    <br />
    ANDY<br />
<br />
Yup.<br />

JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Skip?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Uh-huh. Box. Got it.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That box contains something truly magical.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Is it Christmas?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. Better. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL tosses the key to ANDY)<br />

 I don't get it.<br />

ANDY<br />
(amazed. To WILL) We're gonna soak the bastards!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Why?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we were made fun of. For every time we were walked over or treated like shit. This is karma at its finest boys! <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Blown! My mind is officially blown. <br />
<br />
(SKIP takes the key from ANDY) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We've waited for this moment for five years and tomorrow it's on. All we have to do is reset the timer.<br />

I have my sources.<br />

ANDY<br />
FAT PAT!?<br />

SKIP<br />
Who?<br />

WILL<br />
(to SKIP, referencing ANDY) Exactly why I didn't want to tell you!<br />

Andy - <br />

ANDY<br />
What!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Don't call her thick!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I'm creating a visual. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You did just call her Fat Pat.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to WILL) Wait, is this the girl who asked you to homecoming, but you said no for religious reasons? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
That's the one!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Why'd she give it to you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(a slight hesitation) Cause she was being nice.<br />
    <br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
(joking) Yeah right! What'd you do, take her out on a date?<br />

WILL<br />

We just went out to eat.<br />

ANDY<br />
To EAT!? That's an operation. Where'd you take her? Arby's? No wait! No no wait I got it - it's coming to me - where would you take her so no one would see you AND your jew ass could feed her for cheap.... Denny's!<br />
<br />
(WILL remains silent.)<br />

All I'm saying is she's a sure thing. (putting his arm around WILL) And Will, buddy, you need to start taking advantage of these opportunities. Cause let's be honest, you didn't really get any this year.<br />

WILL<br />
(pushing ANDY away) Just cuz I didn't want any of the diseased skanks that you and your frat brothers hooked up with doesn't mean I didn't get any.<br />

ANDY<br />
HAHA! FATTY PATTY!<br />
<br />
(Throughout WILL's phone call the boys do everything they can to distract him. Sexual sounds, etc.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(glares at SKIP) It's Will! Hi. I'm fine. Listen, I'm calling because there seems to have been a bit of a mix up. The key that you gave me doesn't work. Yeah, nope.  So I was just wondering if there was any possibility - (beat) Oh, really!? No, that would be amazing! Thank you. (beat) Uh... Friday?<br />

ANDY<br />

WILL<br />

<br />
Yea I'll be okay, just broke a few bones. Sure. Yeah just give me a call back okay. Great! Thanks!<br />

ANDY<br />

WILL<br />
Cover.<br />

JACK<br />

<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
She's babysitting right now, so she's going to look and see what she can find. She said she'd call me back.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
So we're just waiting?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
Dammit.<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I feel like we should have brought a board game or something.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Like Jenga!?<br />
<br />
    <br />
    Page 31<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Jenga's not a board game!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I was thinking more along the lines of like Monopoly.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I hate Monopoly.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You would.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is that supposed to mean?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You're just not a Monopoly kinda guy. <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yea, cuz I hate it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, I think it's more that you don't get it.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh I get it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you'<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w44823")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w44823")' onclick='show("w44823")' id='b44823'>va</span> acquired. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Thank you for admitting it.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
My roommate started a board game club in our dorm room this year. Didn't even ask.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What a dick! What games?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Just one. Clue.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Ohhh Lord. I can only imagine the people who wanted to join that club.<br />

Actually there were only five kids who kept coming back, but Jesus Christ they were annoying. They called themselves "the Clue Crew."<br />

He was fine. I only had to put up with him for a little while.<br />

WILL<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Did he get kicked out?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Cause this kid on our floor got kicked out for smoking weed in his room. (to WILL) Remember Stevey?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Smart kid too ... he tried to create this like ventilation system out his window so the RA couldn't smell it. But somebody saw the smoke outside and called the fire department. Now he goes to community college. Fuckin' sucks.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to JACK) What happened to him?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />

    Page 33<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I didn't see him as much.<br />

JACK<br />

<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Wow, you're being awfully descriptive.<br />

JACK<br />
Well... (pause) I don't know. Ok. Actually I left before the semester ended. So....<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
That's awesome! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />

    Page 34<br />

SKIP<br />
Wow, that's awesome! I'm jealous.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Wait...you've been home for three weeks? Why didn't you call us? (referencing ANDY too) We've been here.  <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I know. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I thought you were still at school. Did you not want us to know you were back?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No Will, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just needed some time alone.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Well, I don't care, I wanna know everything! Where'd you go? What'd you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />

JACK<br />
Okay...<br />
<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL<br />
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP<br />
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You kissed your Mom Dude? Gross...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR<br />
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT<br />
<br />
BUT I DIDN'T CARE<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />
<br />
Page 35<br />
<br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />

I mean, was it something that you <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w44878")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w44878")' onclick='show("w44878")' id='b44878'></span>always <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w44879")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w44879")' onclick='show("w44879")' id='b44879'>knew</span> or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And I kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, long beat)<br />
<br />
    Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
        <br />

<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
    <br />
    Page 66<br />
<br />
    IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
<br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
        <br />
        Page 67<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away.  Silence.)<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What was that for?<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What are you doing?<br />
<br />
(JACK and WILL pull away from each other)<br />

JACK<br />

ANDY<br />

ANDY<br />

JACK<br />
He was being a good friend, Andy. I think I have the right to know that.<br />

JACK<br />
(to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
    <br />
    73<br />
<br />
    CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
<br />
SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

MY NEXT STORY<br />

<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
<br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
  <br />
  Page 81<br />
<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE<br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
    AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY    <br />

    <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b44792")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b44792")' onclick='show("b44792")' id='w44792'>REMEMBER</span> WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />
Page 1<br />
<br />
    SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL begins flipping through the pages of his notebook)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />

    <br />
 SKIP<br />
Who're you talking to...? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(startled) Skip!! Heyyy!! <br />
<br />
(WILL slams his notebook shut and tosses it under the bench) <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(imitating) Heyyy buddy!!<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's so good to see you.<br />
<br />
(WILL hugs SKIP)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You too. (beat) Where are the other fools? I thought you said midnight.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(exasperated) I know... I probably should have told them 9. (beat) What's up with your hair? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You like? I'm just letting nature do its thing. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(amused) You look like a girl.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, you wanna start already? Cause we can go Tubs Tubs!<br />
<br />
(SKIP playfully slaps WILL's stomach) <br />
   <br />

WHEN EVER THEY DO GET HERE, I'M<br />

HOPING YOU'RE READY <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What are we doing?  <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I can't tell you that. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Why not? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(coyly) Cause... I don't know if I trust you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Just tell me!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Not yet!<br />
WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT<br />

"WHAT THIS HIGH SCHOOL MEANS TO ME" <br />

    WILL<br />
<br />
FINE. DO YOU LIKE WATER RIDES?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Are we going to Sea World? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Really?!<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope. But close.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 I hate you. (beat) Is it something -?  <br />
       <br />
<br />
WILL <br />
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS<br />
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO<br />
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO<br />
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU<br />
<br />
(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.) <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?  <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Superman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) Fuck that!<br />

WILL<br />
Jaaaack!<br />

JACK<br />
Wiiill! What's up Holmes!?<br />
    <br />
<br />
    ANDY<br />
        What's up Skillet!?<br />
    <br />
(WILL and JACK hug and continue their own conversation)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(sees SKIP) Hey, who's the hippie?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, nice to see you too.<br />
<br />
(ANDY hugs SKIP. Without missing a beat, ANDY tries to get SKIP's opinion on the whole Batman vs. Superman debate.)  <br />
<br />
WILL <br />
(to JACK) ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT? <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST YEAR!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(looking around)I GOTTA SAY IT'S PRETTY WEIRD <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HOW WAS LIFE AT SCHOOL?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
PROBABLY THE SAME AS YOU<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S TRUE UNLESS YOU ROOMED WITH ANDY TOO.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to ANDY) Drop it - <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU THINK THAT BATMAN<br />
WOULD LOSE A BATTLE TO A GUY IN TIGHTS? <br />
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE GAY RED UNDIES <br />
<br />
HE WEARS OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN <br />
TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN<br />
    <br />
    Page 6<br />
<br />
BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT <br />
<br />
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What's your point?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sooo... ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
WILL<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
JACK<br />

ANDY (to JACK)<br />
YOU ONLY LIKE SUPERMAN CAUSE HE FLIES<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I said I was sorry! I'm sorry! <br />
<br />
(WILL runs over to his backpack)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Slobbers? What was he doing?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I was not!<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I was not!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Slobbering all over the sofa.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Whatever man! My sister was watching it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Oh yeaaah, how's she doing? <br />
<br />
(JACK laughs)<br />
ANDY<br />
(to SKIP) <br />
Don't start man -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What!? I'm genuinely interested!<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(suspicious) She's fine.<br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I'm gonna punch you in the face - <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Hey now, there's no need to get all huffy...it's not my fault your sister's bangin'!<br />
<br />
    ANDY<br />
She's twelve years old!  <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Hey, whatever floats your boat, right? <br />
    <br />
    Page 8<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to JACK)My sister is not allowed to float anyone's boat!  <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Aww, you're no fun. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
But your sister is! <br />
<br />
SKIP and JACK<br />
OHHHHHHH!!(raspberry <br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP and JACK slap high five) <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(grabbing at SKIP and JACK)Come here!<br />
    <br />
(ANDY chases SKIP and JACK around the field)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
What? Take it as a compliment. You've got good genes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I swear to God-<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY!<br />
    <br />
(WILL throws his arms around ANDY to hold him back. Andy continues to struggle) <br />
<br />
<br />
(to ANDY)Chill! Look, we've got important business to take care of - <br />
<br />
    (ANDY stops struggling and WILL releases him.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
I got you later!  <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Oh yeah?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, I do!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 (scolding) Okay, enough! Here. Read.<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL hands ANDY a newspaper clipping)<br />
<br />
    Page 9<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sarcastic) A piece of paper.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Just read!<br />
<br />
(ANDY takes a look at the paper. Clears his throat and reads)<br />

ANDY<br />

<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Keep reading!<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
Shut up! (to WILL) What the hell is this? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This,my friend, is inspiration.   <br />
<br />
<br />
    (WILL takes the paper from ANDY and walks back towards the player's bench) <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? <br />
    <br />
    Page 10<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Oh Jesus.... (i.e. "here we go again...")<br />
<br />
(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please? <br />
<br />
<br />
(ANDY <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b44797")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b44797")' onclick='show("b44797")' id='w44797'>obliges, easily amused by his own improvised drum roll. His drum roll slows as the names start to land</span>) <br />
<br />
Matt Hoffman, Chris Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No shit!? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle. You see that box?<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL points to a small weather box situated near the players bench)<br />
ANDY<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Skip?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Uh-huh. Box. Got it.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That box contains something truly magical.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Is it Christmas?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No. Better. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. <br />
<br />
(WILL tosses the key to ANDY)<br />

JACK <br />
 I don't get it.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(amazed. To WILL) We're gonna soak the bastards!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Why?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we were made fun of. For every time we were walked over or treated like shit. This is karma at its finest boys! <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Blown! My mind is officially blown. <br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP takes the key from ANDY) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We've waited for this moment for five years and tomorrow it's on. All we have to do is reset the timer.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(extends his hand to WILL) Well done sir! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(shakes ANDY's hand) Ah thank you!<br />

I have my sources.<br />

Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.<br />

WILL<br />
We just went out to eat.<br />

ANDY<br />
To EAT!? That's an operation. Where'd you take her? Arby's? No wait! No no wait I got it - it's coming to me - where would you take her so no one would see you AND your jew ass could feed her for cheap.... Denny's!<br />

She's not a catch and you know it!<br />

ANDY<br />
All I'm saying is she's a sure thing. (putting his arm around WILL) And Will, buddy, you need to start taking advantage of these opportunities. Cause let's be honest, you didn't really get any this year.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(pushing ANDY away) Just cuz I didn't want any of the diseased skanks that you and your frat brothers hooked up with doesn't mean I didn't get any.<br />

WILL<br />
And it sends a message. (the boys are unconvinced) It does!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />

What message is that?<br />
    <br />

<br />
WILL<br />
That we deserve respect.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
From who?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
From them!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh that makes a ton of sense. (beat) Will. You really think they're gonna start respecting us for setting off sprinklers during their little charity football game?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not about that - it's.... (beat) Come on, don't you think they deserve it!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Will it was five years ago!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
So!? It still happened! And all because we didn't make their precious little team -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Here we go. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
But Will, they're not gonna care. They never did, so why would they start now?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Then maybe, it's not about them! Maybe it's about us!<br />

RIGHT HERE <br />

THAT'S WHAT I USED TO THINK<br />
RIGHT WHEN I WAS ON THE BRINK<br />
OF BEING JUST ANOTHER KINK IN THEIR SOCIAL REGIME<br />
BUT MY LIFE GOT TURNED AROUND <br />
WHEN I FOUND I GOT CUT FROM THEIR FOOTBALL TEAM<br />

I'm sorry... Patty?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
HAHA! FATTY PATTY!<br />
<br />
(Throughout WILL's phone call the boys do everything they can to distract him. Sexual sounds, etc.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(glares at SKIP) It's Will! Hi. I'm fine. Listen, I'm calling because there seems to have been a bit of a mix up. The key that you gave me doesn't work. Yeah, nope.  So I was just wondering if there was any possibility - (beat) Oh, really!? No, that would be amazing! Thank you. (beat) Uh... Friday?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />

<br />
Yea I'll be okay, just broke a few bones. Sure. Yeah just give me a call back okay. Great! Thanks!<br />

WILL<br />

JACK <br />

<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
She's babysitting right now, so she's going to look and see what she can find. She said she'd call me back.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
So we're just waiting?<br />

WILL<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
Dammit.<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
I feel like we should have brought a board game or something. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Like Jenga!?<br />
<br />
    <br />
    Page 31<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Jenga's not a board game!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I was thinking more along the lines of like Monopoly.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I hate Monopoly.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You would.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is that supposed to mean?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You're just not a Monopoly kinda guy. <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yea, cuz I hate it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, I think it's more that you don't get it.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh I get it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you'<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b44823")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b44823")' onclick='show("b44823")' id='w44823'>ve</span> acquired. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Thank you for admitting it.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
My roommate started a board game club in our dorm room this year. Didn't even ask.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What a dick! What games?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Just one. Clue.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Ohhh Lord. I can only imagine the people who wanted to join that club.<br />

Actually there were only five kids who kept coming back, but Jesus Christ they were annoying. They called themselves "the Clue Crew."<br />

JACK<br />
He was fine. I only had to put up with him for a little while.<br />

WILL<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Did he get kicked out?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Cause this kid on our floor got kicked out for smoking weed in his room. (to WILL) Remember Stevey?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Smart kid too ... he tried to create this like ventilation system out his window so the RA couldn't smell it. But somebody saw the smoke outside and called the fire department. Now he goes to community college. Fuckin' sucks.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to JACK) What happened to him?<br />
<br />
    JACK<br />
        Who?<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
I didn't see him as much.<br />

Wow, that's awesome! I'm jealous.<br />

Wait...you've been home for three weeks? Why didn't you call us? (referencing ANDY too) We've been here.  <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I know. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I thought you were still at school. Did you not want us to know you were back?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No Will, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just needed some time alone.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Well, I don't care, I wanna know everything! Where'd you go? What'd you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!<br />

I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />
    <br />
    Page 35<br />
<br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />

MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY<br />
THAT I WOULD FIND SOME REAL FRIENDS TO GUIDE ME SOMEDAY<br />
AND NOW<br />

<br />
WHEN I FEEL ALONE, I HAVE THESE FRIENDS OF MINE<br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME, WHO KEEP ME SANE IN TROUBLED TIMES<br />
AND WHEN I LOSE MY WAY, I HAVE THEM THERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND<br />
AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY<br />
WHEN I FEEL ALONE <br />
<br />
THEY'VE ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS ON ALL THE THINGS WE SAID WE LOVED<br />
CAUSE EVERYONE'S DECIDED THAT THIS ISNT WHAT IT WAS<br />
WELL NOBODY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT WE'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE<br />
<br />
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IM THE ONE WHO'S STILL THE SAME<br />
AND NOW<br />
<br />
I AM STILL ALONE WITH ALL THESE FRIENDS OF MINE<br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME WHO RAN AWAY IN TROUBLED TIMES<br />
AND NOW I FEEL THE SHAME OF HOLDING ONTO WHAT'S NO LONGER MINE<br />
MAYBE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AFTER ALL<br />
AND I JUST NEVER SAW IT AT ALL<br />

Well... there's that window in the gym. The one we used to sneak out of during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />
<br />
ARE YOU READY REPRISE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
AREN'T YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />

WILL<br />
I'VE BEEN READY SINCE 5 YEARS AGO<br />

TRESPASSING'S A CRIME, YOU KNOW<br />

SKIP<br />

ANDY<br />
All right. Let's fucking do this!<br />

(SKIP and ANDY exit, whooping and hollering. WILL and JACK are left alone.)<br />

WILL<br />
SSShhhhhhhhhhhhh! Guys! <br />

<br />
JACK<br />
They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence) <br />
<br />
    So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No. There isn't. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Kissed?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
        <br />
        Page 64<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
About what? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You know. I mean, was it something that you'<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b44878")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b44878")' onclick='show("b44878")' id='w44878'>ve</span> always <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b44879")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b44879")' onclick='show("b44879")' id='w44879'>known</span> or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And I kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, long beat)<br />
<br />
    Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
        <br />
        Page 65<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
    <br />
    Page 66<br />
<br />
    IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
<br />
        <br />
        Page 67<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away.  Silence.)<br />

WILL<br />
What was that for?<br />

(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />

MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
            <br />
            Page 81<br />
<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
    AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY    <br />
    <br />

<br />
    CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)<br />
<br />
THE END.<br />
<br />
GLORY DAYS<br />
