GLORY DAYS<br />
A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
<br />
RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench.)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM &#x2010; JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
    <br />
    Page 2<br />
<br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL pulls his notebook out of his backpack)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
 <br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
Who're you talking to...? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(startled) Skip!! Heyyy!! <br />

SKIP<br />

WILL<br />

SKIP<br />

<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You like? I'm just letting nature do its thing.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(amused) You look like a girl.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, you wanna start already? Cause we can go if you want!<br />
<br />

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            SKIP <br />
     Wanna go? Let's go! Who's a girl now? Huh? Wanna cry?<br />

            WILL<br />
                I'm joking! No. Okay, okay! No, no, no. I'm sorry.  Cut it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HEY, look, if you don't stop I'm not gonna tell you what we're doing tonight!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(stops) What we're doing? I thought this was it.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope. I've got a plan. Tell me &#x2010;<br />

SKIP<br />
HOW 'BOUT A HINT?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 HOW 'BOUT WE WAIT FOR ALL THE GUYS<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'LL ACT LIKE I'M STILL SURPRISED<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
FINE. DO YOU LIKE WATER RIDES?<br />
<br />
Page 5<br />
SKIP<br />
Are we going to Sea World?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Really?!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope. But close.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 I hate you. (beat) Is it something -? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS<br />
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO<br />
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO<br />
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU<br />
<br />
(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.) <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Superman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) Fuck that!<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Jaaaack!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Wiiill! What's up Holmes!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What's up Skillet!?<br />
<br />
    Page 6<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(sees SKIP) Hey, who's the hippie?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, nice to see you too.<br />
<br />
(Without missing a beat, ANDY tries to get SKIP's opinion on the whole Batman vs. Superman debate.)  <br />
<br />
WILL <br />
<br />
(to JACK)ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST YEAR!<br />

<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HOW WAS LIFE AT SCHOOL?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
PROBABLY THE SAME AS YOU<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S TRUE UNLESS YOU ROOMED WITH ANDY TOO.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to ANDY) Drop it &#x2010;<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU THINK THAT BATMAN<br />
WOULD LOSE A BATTLE TO A GUY IN TIGHTS? <br />
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THOSE GAY RED UNDIES <br />
HE WEARS OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS? <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN <br />
TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN<br />
<br />
BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT <br />
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
What's your point?<br />
    <br />
    Page 7<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
JACK<br />

SKIP<br />
What took you guys so long?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
    (indicating ANDY) Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I said I was sorry! I'm sorry! <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Slobbers? What was he doing?<br />
<br />
    Page 8<br />
JACK<br />
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I was not! <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I was not! <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Slobbering all over the sofa. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Whatever man! My sister was watching it. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh yeaaah, how's she doing? <br />
<br />
(JACK laughs)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to SKIP)  Don't start -<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What!? I'm genuinely interested!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(suspicious) She's fine.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me? <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
She's twelve years old!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Hey, whatever floats your boat, right? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to JACK) My sister is not allowed to float anyone's boat!<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Aww, you're no fun.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
But your sister is! <br />
<br />
SKIP and <br />
JACK<br />
OHHHHHHH!!(raspberry)<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP and JACK slap high five)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(grabbing at SKIP and JACK)You're both dead! Come here!<br />
<br />
    Page 9<br />
SKIP<br />
What? Take it as a compliment, you're sister's banging!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yeah, you've got good genes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I swear to God-<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY!<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL throws his arms around ANDY to hold him back.) <br />
<br />
(to ANDY)Chill! Look, we've got important business to take care of - <br />
<br />
(ANDY stops struggling and WILL releases him.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I got you later!  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
            <br />
                <br />
                    <br />

                        <br />
                        <br />
                            <br />
                        <br />
                    <br />
                <br />
<br />
                SKIP<br />
Oh yeah?<br />
<br />
                JACK<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
   Yeah, I do!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
   (scolding) Okay, enough! Here. Read.<br />
<br />
(WILL hands ANDY a newspaper clipping)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Just read!<br />
<br />
(ANDY takes a look at the paper. Clears his throat and reads)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(reading)"Come one, come all to the First Annual Fighting Beavers Alumni Football Game." What!? FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit?<br />
    <br />
<br />
    WILL<br />
        Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own. <br />
        <br />
    ANDY<br />
        But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />
    <br />
<br />
    <br />
    Page 10<br />
<br />
    WILL<br />
        Keep reading!<br />
    <br />
    ANDY<br />
        Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." <br />
<br />
    <br />
    SKIP<br />
        Wow, you read that really well!<br />
    <br />
    ANDY<br />
        Shut up! (to WILL) What the hell is this? <br />
<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
This, my friend, is inspiration.<br />
<br />
(WILL takes the paper from ANDY and walks back towards the player's bench) <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh no....<br />
<br />
(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
    Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Ah, hell yeah!(ANDY begins drum roll)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Matt Hoffman, Christian Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No shit!? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
    Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Is it Jesus?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No. Better. You see that box?<br />
<br />
    Page 11<br />
(WILL points to a small weather box situated near the players bench)<br />
<br />
                <br />

                    <br />

                    <br />
    <br />
                    ANDY<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
                    JACK<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
                    SKIP<br />
Uh-huh. Box. Got it.<br />
<br />
                    <br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
That box contains something truly magical. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL tosses the key to ANDY)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(gets it) Fucking genius!<br />
<br />
JACK <br />
 I don't get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(amazed. To WILL) We're gonna soak the bastards!<br />
<br />
    JACK<br />
 Why?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
     Cause it's funny as shit!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we got walked on or treated like we didn't matter. This is karma at its finest boys! <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Blown! My mind is officially blown. <br />
<br />
(SKIP takes the key from ANDY) <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
    We've waited for this moment for five years and tomorrow it's on. All we have to do is reset the timer.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
How did you even get this?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I have my sources.<br />
<br />

Look, it doesn't matter how I got it! The fact is I got it! So come on let's do this! (walks to box)   <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Why're you being so weird?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'm not. It's just not important.<br />

SKIP<br />
Will, you can't do that!<br />

Yeah, you have to tell us!<br />

You don't remember Hannah!? Sophomore? Redhead? She's the janitor's niece. Kinda ... horsefaced!<br />

WILL<br />
Andy &#x2010; <br />

ANDY<br />

WILL<br />
Don't call her that!<br />

ANDY<br />

JACK<br />

ANDY<br />
That's the one!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
Why'd she give it to you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(a slight hesitation) Cause she was being nice.<br />
   <br />
ANDY<br />
(joking) Yeah right! What'd you do, take her out on a date?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />

To EAT!? You mean GRAZE!<br />

ANDY<br />
    Ah come on man. We're just playing! Look, I'm really proud of you! She's a catch.<br />

JACK<br />

WILL<br />
She's not a catch and you know it!<br />

ANDY<br />
Why?<br />

WILL<br />
Cause she's...<br />

ANDY<br />
...ugly? That's fucked up Will.<br />

(SKIP and JACK laughs at this)<br />
<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
 I didn't say that. You're the one calling her that!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
All I'm saying is... she's a sure thing. (putting his arm around WILL) And Will, buddy, you need to start taking advantage of these opportunities. Cause let's be honest, you didn't really get any this year.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(pushing ANDY away) Just cuz I didn't want any of the diseased skanks that you and your frat brothers hooked up with doesn't mean I didn't get any.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What are you talking about? Those girls were prime real estate!<br />

Woah, woah, woah. I'm sorry. You joined a frat? <br />

SKIP<br />
And it's just lame.<br />

ANDY<br />
You're lame!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Isn't that kinda like buying your friends? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(offended) No! It's about a brotherhood.  A fellowship! A bond! <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That you pay for.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Whatever man, all I know is I was getting some high quality poon this year while you were sitting alone in the room jerkin the gherkin! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I was not.<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
Oh really? Why don't you tell Jack and Skip how many girls you boofed?<br />

WILL<br />
They don't care. Now can we just set off some damn -<br />

You don't have to talk to 'em when you're doing it.<br />

I can't believe you two lived in the same room for a whole year.<br />

It was hard, he never showers.<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
Shut up dude!<br />

WILL<br />
Maybe once a week.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Whatever, I was a great roommate.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want to live with you. <br />

ANDY<br />
Why!? (puts his hand on JACK) We could be bunk buddies! (JACK shrugs him off)<br />
<br />
    Page 20<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Can you imagine if the four of us had lived together? I mean what if we had all actually gone to the same school?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That would've been tight! The four of us in a suite, trading bitches like Pokemon cards!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Sorry for ruining your dream.<br />

WILL<br />
I mean, just think of all the stuff we could've pulled on a college campus. <br />

SKIP<br />
You mean stupid pranks like this one?<br />

WILL<br />
What are you talking about? This is gonna be epic! We're gonna go down in history for this.<br />

With who? No one's even gonna know we did it!<br />

Um, we'll know.<br />

SKIP<br />
Excuse me?<br />

No I don't! <br />

ANDY<br />
What about that time we took out your Dad's Jeep.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
That was my idea!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but you were so nervous. "I dunno guys, maybe we should abort..."<br />
<br />
Page 21<br />
JACK<br />
To be fair, his dad is pretty frightening.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yea, but who says abort?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
My dad's in the military, jackass!<br />

ANDY<br />
Yeah, but you're not! Nobody said you had to speak like a douchebag!<br />

You gotta turn it &#x2010; to the -<br />

What's wrong?<br />

ANDY<br />
(to WILL) You got the wrong key! <br />

WILL<br />
I got the wrong key!? This is what she gave me. <br />

ANDY<br />
God damn it HORESFACE HANNAH! <br />

Andy &#x2010;<br />

She probably just got em mixed up.<br />

JACK<br />
Can you call her?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
What? No!<br />

ANDY<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You call her!<br />

ANDY<br />
Why the hell would I call her? She's your girlfriend!<br />

WILL<br />
She is not, shut up!<br />

ANDY<br />
Look, stop being a pussy. (ANDY takes out his phone) If she got em mixed up then she can bring over the right one-<br />

(ANDY tosses his phone to WILL)<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, its gonna give her the wrong idea.<br />

(WILL tosses the phone back to ANDY)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Just tell her to put down the oats and get over here&#x2010;<br />

WILL<br />
<br />
I'm not doing it!<br />

ANDY<br />
Well I guess we can't do the prank then.<br />

Jesus Christ, who cares!?<br />

WILL<br />
What do you mean who cares? <br />

ANDY<br />
What are we supposed to do now?<br />

SKIP<br />
Why don't we try hanging out for a change? You ever think of that?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
We are.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally together in the same place. Isn't that enough? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Sorry.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Think about it. We don't have to associate ourselves with this place ever again, so why do you wanna come back and pull some stupid prank? We're past that.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not stupid! <br />

JACK<br />
It's pretty stupid.<br />

Sorry, it is.<br />

        Guys! Andy? Help me out here.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
I mean, yeah, I still think it'd be funny as shit. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
And it sends a message. (the boys are unconvinced) It does!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What message is that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That we deserve respect.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Page 25<br />
    SKIP<br />
From who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
From them!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Oh that makes a ton of sense, Will. (beat) You really think they're gonna start respecting us for setting off sprinklers during their little charity football game?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not about that!<br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
Then what's it -<br />
    <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Skip, if he wants to do it, let him do it.<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
No, I want ALL of us to do it! Come on, don't you think they deserve it!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Will it was five years ago!<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
So!? It still happened! And all because we didn't make their precious little team -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Here we go. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No! They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
But Will, they're not gonna care. They never did, so why would they start now?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Then maybe, it's not about them! Maybe it's about us!<br />

RIGHT HERE<br />

WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG<br />
DIDN'T YOU HAVE DREAMS THAT YOU LET GO OF<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
Will?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />

<br />
(WILL takes out his phone and dials)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That's my boy. Take one for the team!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I'm always taking one for the team.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

WILL<br />
(into the phone) Hi, Hannah?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Neiiiiiiiigh! (like a horse)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(glares at SKIP) It's Will! Hi. I'm fine. Listen, I'm calling because there seems to have been a bit of a mix up. The key that you gave me doesn't work. Yeah, nope.  So I was just wondering if there was any possibility - (beat) Oh, really!? No, that would be amazing! Thank you. (beat) Uh... Friday? Umm... I'm actually kinda busy then... (looking to the guys for help)<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
No you're not...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(looking to the guys for help) I just &#x2010;I got in a car accident yesterday, so... I'm injured.<br />
<br />
(SKIP, ANDY and JACK start laughing)<br />
<br />
<br />
    Page 29<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />

<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Cover. <br />
<br />
JACK <br />
What'd she say?<br />
<br />
WILL <br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
So we're just waiting?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I guess so.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Dammit.<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I feel like we should have brought a board game or something. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Like Jenga!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Jenga's not a board game!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I was thinking more along the lines of like Monopoly.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I hate Monopoly.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You would.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is that supposed to mean?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
You're just not a Monopoly kinda guy. <br />
    <br />
    Page 30<br />
ANDY<br />
Yea, cuz I hate it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, I think it's more that you don't get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh I get it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you've acquired. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Thank you for admitting it.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
My roommate started a board game club in our dorm room this year. Didn't even ask me.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What a dick! What games?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
The worts one. Clue.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Ohhh Lord. I can only imagine the people who wanted to join that club.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Actually there were only five kids who kept coming back, but you guys would have loved this, they called themselves "the Clue Crew."<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That's freakin weird dude. Your roommate sounds worse then Will.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Bite me.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was fine. I only had to put up with him for a little while.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Did he get kicked out?<br />
    <br />
    Page 31<br />
JACK<br />
No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What happened to him? <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What do you mean?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Then why did you only put up with him for a little while?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I didn't see him as much.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Just cause.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Wow, you're being awfully descriptive.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Well... (pause) Ok. Fuck. Actually I left before the semester ended. So....<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
Are you shitting me?! That's huge!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
How long were you gone?<br />

SKIP<br />
Wow, that's awesome! I'm jealous.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Wait...you've been home for three weeks? Why didn't you call us? (referencing ANDY too) We've been here.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I know. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I thought you were still at school. Did you not want us to know you were back?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just needed some time alone.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Well, I don't care, I wanna know everything! Where'd you go? What'd you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!<br />

THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL<br />
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP<br />
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
You kissed your Mom Dude? Gross...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR<br />
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT<br />
BUT I DIDN'T CARE<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />
<br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
Wow, that's awesome! I'm jealous.<br />
    <br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED ABOUT EACH OTHER'S LIVES<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
    Page 34<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />

DONT MAKE IT SOUND <br />
 LIKE I'M WRONG<br />
    <br />
I WISH THINGS COULD STAY <br />
THE WAY THEY WERE ALL<br />
ALONG, BUT...<br />
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT, WILL<br />
THINGS HAVE CHANGED<br />
JACK IS NO LONGER WITH US<br />
ONLY THE SURFACE REMAINS<br />
NOW ITS JUST YOU AND ME <br />
AND SKIP.  WE'LL WORK AS THREE<br />
    <br />
    <br />
                                    WILL<br />
YOU'RE NOT<br />
WRONG, BUT...<br />
NEITHER IS THIS ANDY, THIS IS JUST NEW<br />
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU CANT LOVE HIM<br />
JACK NEVER SAID THAT YOU HAD TO LIVE<br />
YOUR LIFE ONE WAY<br />
LET GO OF YOUR BIAS, HE IS YOUR FRIEND <br />
OR THIS COULD BE<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL AND ANDY<br />
NOT FOUR ANYMORE<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy &#x2010;<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME TO DO?<br />
<br />
    Page 39<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
LET IT GO<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
IS THIS FOR HIM OR FOR YOU?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
JUST LET IT GO<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING THIS ON ME <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK, IM NOT SAYING I DISAGREE<br />
<br />
BUT PLEASE, FOR ME, KEEP QUIET<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Fine.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Fine.<br />

(ANDY sits on the bleachers, while WILL walks down the field. JACK and SKIP enter carrying two cases of Natty Light)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
The pride parade is back!<br />
<br />
(JACK and SKIP set the cases on the player's bench.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What did you get?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Only the best for my boys! Natty Light!<br />
<br />
(SKIP tosses a can of Natty Light to WILL)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(sarcastic) Mmm... Did you steal these from your Dad's fridge?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Nope! (proudly) Bought em.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
How?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
THIS guy!<br />
<br />
    Page 40<br />
<br />
(SKIP flashes a fake ID)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Let me see that.<br />
<br />
(SKIP hands the ID to WILL)<br />
SKIP<br />
(recites the info from memory) Julio Mendez. 5225 Ridgemont Court. Ironwood, Minnesota.   September 7th, 1983.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Impressive.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I know.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This looks nothing like you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Sure it does!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This kid is Hispanic.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well it worked didn't it?<br />
<br />
(SKIP takes his ID away from WILL)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
(grabbing a beer) You know, I didn't have a single drop of alcohol this past year, and guess what, I'm still sane.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah but you're gay. See what sobriety can do to you? <br />
<br />
(Awkward silence. Musical Break.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(WILL, covering, takes a sip.) This stuff is terrible!<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Then don't drink it.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Just saying, I thought you had better taste then this.<br />
<br />
    Page 41<br />
SKIP<br />
Listen, I had ten dollars.  For ten dollars, this is quality.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(to WILL) Did what's her face call?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
How long are we gonna to wait around for this girl?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I don't know. You got places to be?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, I just don't wanna be out here all night! That's all!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Amen to that.<br />
<br />
(Awkward silence. Musical Break.) <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to JACK, about SKIP) So what do you think of this new look?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I wasn't gonna say anything but, you kinda look like a pothead. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I think he looks like Anne Heche. <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I don't really care if it looks good or not. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You should.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Why? Who am I trying to impress?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Not us, apparently. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised. I thought you were gonna come back looking like a total Ivy Leauge prep. You know, pink polo with the popped collar...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Never! My roommate was like that. He wore plaid shorts every day of the week. It'd be 15 degrees outside and he'd still be wearing plaid shorts and boat shoes. Dumbass.<br />
    <br />
    Page 42<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sounds like your kind of guy.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Not to mention the fact that his dad bought him a Lexus when he graduated from high school. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Jesus.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I got a check from my grandma that bounced.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah. And he was all pissed off cause it wasn't a Beamer. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Shut up!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
So what did you say?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
To him - about the car.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What was I supposed to say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, a guy like that &#x2010; I figured you'd let him have it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Why would I "let him have it?" Nothing I'm gonna say is gonna change anything, so why waste the energy?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
...When you can just grow your hair out.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Exactly!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Are you kidding me?! <br />
<br />
<br />
    Page 43<br />
SKIP<br />
What?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I've just never heard of you backing down from an opportunity like that. You're the most opinionated guy I know.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
My opinion doesn't mean shit Will! It's just one opinion. So why not go with the flow? I mean I'm doing your prank, aren't I?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not my prank! It's OUR prank!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Right. I forgot. Sorry. My point is who cares.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What is this "who cares" thing?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
I mean no one really listens to anyone anyway, they're all too wrapped up in themselves. So why should I be any different?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Because you are. You always have been. It's why we're friends.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I thought we were friends because we sucked at football.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. We're friends because we're - <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Different? No we're not. You'd like to think we are. But you're sitting here, talking about how things should change. And not doing shit. Just like everybody else.<br />
<br />
GENERATION APATHY<br />
<br />
IN A WORLD THAT DEFINES ITSELF WITH X's Y2K's and Z's<br />
YOU'RE PRESENT FOR A 3RD WORLD WAR<br />
THATS REAL BUT YOU CHOOSE NOT TO SEE<br />
YOU DON'T CARE OR EVER DARE OUTSIDE OF YOUR COMPLACENCY<br />
<br />
BUT IT'S NOT JUST YOU, THERE'S A NEW WORLD ORDER:<br />
GENERATION APATHY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I am not like that.<br />
<br />
    Page 44<br />
SKIP<br />
Yes you are, you just don't notice.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
WE'RE ALL VIRGINS WHO ARE BURGEONING WITH READINESS FOR MORE<br />
BUT WE'VE GOT PORNOS IN OUR DRAWER<br />
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THE DOOR <br />
WE FEED A NEED TO NEVER BLEED UNLESS WE'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE <br />
WE GO THROUGH PAINSTAKING MEANS TO NEVER FEEL PAIN ANYMORE <br />
<br />
WE USED TO BE YOUNG AND STUPID BUT NOW WE'RE JUST YOUNG <br />
<br />
CAUSE WE DON'T ADMIT THE STUPID SHIT WE'VE DONE NOW THAT REAL LIFE HAS BEGUN<br />
OUR GENERATION'S WAY OVERSEXED AND UNDERLOVED <br />
AND UNDERWHELMED BY ALL OF THE ABOVE <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Skip I think that's a -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Am I wrong?<br />
<br />
<br />
WE COMPLAIN ABOUT OUR PERFECT LIVES WITH BIGGER WORDS THAN MOST<br />
WE SPEW OUT FACTS AND FIND IT RELAXING TO TALK SHIT AS WE BOAST <br />
ABOUT ME AND ME AND ME AND ME, LET'S ALL RAISE A TOAST <br />
TO THE GENERATION THAT'LL TURN THIS NATION <br />
FROM A SUPERPOWER INTO A GHOST <br />
<br />
OUR FATHERS ARE COMMUTERS, BUT WE'RE STUCK IN OUR COMPUTERS <br />
 WHICH TAKE US ALL AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER, BUT WHO CARES<br />
<br />
CUZ WE'RE TOO OCCUPIED TO NOTICE WHAT WAS THERE HAS DIED <br />
BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WHO USED TO LOVE EACH OTHER, CUZ WHO CARES<br />
THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD WE'RE IN WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT HERE<br />
BUT RATHER THAN FIXING THEM WE'LL JUST JOIN IN WITH THE CHEER<br />
WHO CARES<br />
WHO CARES<br />
WHO CARES WHO CARES WHO CARES<br />
WHO CARES?<br />
<br />
<br />
WE MAY GRADUATE WITH HONORS BUT THERE'S NO HONOR IN IT<br />
WE ARE RUNNING A RACE BUT WE'RE OKAY IF WE DON'T WIN IT <br />
WE ARE SMART BUT WE DON'T TRY &#x2010; THE "DO I HAVE TO?" KIND OF GUY<br />
WHO'LL NEVER RISK AND NEVER FAIL IF HE CAN SPIN IT <br />
CHIVALRY AND BRAVERY AND THE QUALITIES WE USED TO BE <br />
ARE NOW ONLY A MEMORY <br />

I've only got a paragraph left, lemme finish. "When we left the field that day becoming friends seemed like a last resort. But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other." <br />

    Don't you? I mean with all the things that have happened out here? Just think about all that history. How many kids have filed in and out of this building over the years, like it was a goddamn assembly line?<br />

<br />
So many.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
That's not a number, Jack.<br />

    I mean, how many kids do you think have sat out on these bleachers? Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who they are. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...and even then there are probably thousands of Chris' and Amanda's. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I bet Amanda's hot. Just saying.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Seriously there are so many people just like us, who have sat out here, worrying about their futures. Trying to figure out how they fit into the world and hoping that they're special enough, but not sure if they are. <br />
<br />
There's something about being out here though, like some cosmic pull from the universe telling you you're capable of doing something extraordinary. If you can figure out what that is.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Cosmic pull? You sound like a comic book.<br />

WILL<br />
No, I just have a vivid imagination. <br />
<br />
    (WILL's phone rings, Brittany Spears "Toxic" or something equally goofy.)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Is that really your ring?<br />

WILL<br />
What? <br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Yikes man.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Screw you. (answers the phone) Hello!? Horsef---Hannah? Hey! Hi. So did you... Really!? (disappointed) Oh.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(into the phone) Don't worry about it. No no it's okay. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What did she say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Thanks anyway. (beat)  Umm... yeah I'm actually busy Thursday night too so.... Uh-huh. Yeah that's a bad night too. Remember those broken bones. Yup, still broken. So... Okay well gotta run, but I'll talk to you later. Okay. Great! Bye. (hangs up the phone) Jesus.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(to WILL) What's wrong?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That girl does not give up.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
No, what's up with the key!?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Well... she says it's in the building.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently it may be in the maintenance closet.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
So what did she give us?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
She doesn't know, but now she's pretty sure it's in there. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(sarcastic) Well that's great, we probably have his car keys. What are we supposed to do now?<br />
    <br />
    Page 56<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) You know... we could always try and sneak into the building?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Keep talking!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
How?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well... there's that window in the gym. The one we used to sneak out of during assemblies.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh my God, why didn't I think of that!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />
<br />
ARE YOU READY REPRISE<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
AREN'T YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'VE BEEN READY SINCE 5 YEARS AGO<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
TRESPASSING'S A CRIME, YOU KNOW<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
THEN WE'LL ABORT IF COPS SHOW<br />

ANDY<br />
I like where your head's at.<br />

WILL<br />
I DUNNO...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />

SKIP and THE GUYS<br />
NOW ARE YOU READY FOR READY FOR TONIGHT...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
All right. Let's do this!<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP and ANDY exit, whooping and hollering.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Guys!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence) <br />
<br />
So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No. There isn't. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I know who you're talking about Will, relax!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Okay. Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
    <br />
    Page 58<br />
JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
You just did. Something else?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? I mean, was it something you've always known or just suddenly realized or... what?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I dunno &#x2010; I mean, I wanna know what it's like. What you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
    Well... I think I always kinda knew on some level. I just fought it and then I realized I didn't have to. I could be who I am and if people don't like who I am then fuck them. I'm fine.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, beat)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Huh.<br />
    <br />
    JACK<br />
        What?<br />
    <br />
    WILL<br />
        You sound so... grown up.<br />
<br />
    <br />
    JACK<br />
        Does that bother you?<br />
    <br />
    WILL<br />
        Of course not.<br />
    <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Good. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
    <br />
    Page 59<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since &#x2010;I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />

THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
<br />
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT &#x2010;<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
<br />
    <br />
    Page 61<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away. Silence.)<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What was that for?<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What are you doing?<br />
<br />
(JACK and WILL pull away from each other)<br />
<br />

JACK<br />
Shit. <br />

ANDY<br />
Will, what are you DOING?!<br />
    <br />
    Page 62<br />
WILL<br />
Andy &#x2010; It was nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Nothing?! That was nothing?<br />

SKIP<br />
What's going on?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have &#x2010;<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I don't believe this.<br />
<br />
(ANDY grabs his jacket off the bleachers)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, stop!  We need to talk about this...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(boiling.) Will. Do. You. Realize what you just did?!<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You're right! I'm sorry. But it's not what you &#x2010;<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Fuck this.<br />

(ANDY turns to exit)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, come on -<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(overlapping WILL)<br />
Andy, please, can we talk for a second?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to Jack) You came here tonight and dropped this shit on us and thought that everything would be fine. It's NOT fine. You lied to us &#x2010;<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Jesus, he didn't lie to you! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Guys, please -<br />
    <br />
<br />
    Page 63<br />
JACK<br />
(overlapping WILL)<br />
No, you lied to me too, Andy. Will told me what you said.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Jack &#x2010; <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
That you couldn't deal with it. That you've been sitting here all night not saying anything. Why not, why don't you just talk to me?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) Why would you tell him that....<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was being a good friend, Andy. I think I have the right to know that.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) I don't believe you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Why is this bothering you so much?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK <br />
I didn't tell you earlier, because I wasn't ready yet, Andy-<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Look, do whatever you want. I'm going.<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to exit)<br />
SKIP<br />
Why? What the fuck is your deal right now?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Everybody STOP IT! (to ANDY) You're right! I'm sorry. Look its over. (ANDY starts to leave again. Will grabs him) Andy, LISTEN TO ME! <br />
<br />
FORGET ABOUT IT<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG<br />
DIDN'T YOU HAVE DREAMS THAT YOU LET GO OF<br />
 CAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD YOU<br />
THAT YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DREAM THE WAY YOU DO<br />

OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
(to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
Page 67<br />
CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(overlapping)<br />
...LOOK WHO'S "SPEAKING OUT"<br />
<br />
LIKE HE KNOWS ABOUT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
JUST PUT THE BLAME ON ME<br />

    <br />
    Page 68<br />
SKIP<br />

He's supposed to be one of your best friends and you treat him like he wronged you. He did nothing to you. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Skip &#x2010;<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You just fucked up a friendship for all of us because you're too selfish to get that it's not always about YOU!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Can I please say something?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No! Everything that's coming out of your mouth tonight is toxic, and I'm tired of listening to it. <br />

ANDY<br />
I would never call him &#x2010;<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, stop &#x2010;<br />

<br />
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WILL<br />
LOOK AROUND<br />
<br />
YOUR GOOD OLD GLORY DAYS<br />

<br />
(ANDY picks up the notebook up off the bleachers)<br />
<br />
AND ALL OF THESE MEMORIES WE USED TO ENJOY<br />
THE NIGHTS OUT HERE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE<br />
THE BROTHERS THAT NO ONE COULD EVER DESTROY<br />
WERE WORTH NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING!!<br />
<br />
<br />
(ANDY tears the notebook apart.)<br />
<br />
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOYS?<br />
NOW IT IS MY TURN TO ASK YOU<br />
WHAT TO DO?<br />
<br />
WHEN AFTER FIVE YEARS <br />
I DON'T TRUST YOU<br />
WE'VE BEEN BROTHERS FOR SO LONG<br />
AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE - <br />
<br />
<br />
SO IT IS MY TURN - <br />
<br />
IT IS MY TURN<br />
TO GO<br />
    BUT IT IS YOUR TURN<br />
    <br />

TO KNOW <br />
<br />
I'VE NEVER HAD A GIFT LIKE YOURS FOR CLEVER WORDS TO SAY<br />
BUT NOW IT'S MY TURN AND I DONT WANT THEM ANYWAY<br />
<br />
(ANDY exits. WILL, near tears, is on the ground, trying to piece together his journal)<br />
    <br />
    SKIP<br />
What was he talking about? You lied to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything, cause I didn't want anything to get fucked up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing anyways?  Something you wanna tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just &#x2010; let it happen.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />

(WILL continues to pick up the pieces of the notebook)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.<br />

(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, maybe not. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />
    <br />
    Page 71<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know, but when the hell did that happen?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Good question.<br />
<br />
BOYS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN WE WERE BOYS<br />
<br />
WE HAD FUN<br />
AND BLAMED MISTAKES ON BEING HUMAN<br />
<br />
BUT NOW WE'RE OLD<br />
AND EVEN ONE<br />
WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN<br />
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND<br />
<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT ALL OF US DID<br />
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER WE WERE SO SURE<br />
THAT WE'D NEVER STOP BEING BOYS ANYMORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU THINK IS DEAD<br />
YOU'RE WHINING LIKE YOUR LIFE IS OVER<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
IT FEELS THAT WAY<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT NO ONE SAID<br />
YOU CANT SCREW UP WHEN YOU GET OLDER<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WE WERE SO PERFECT TIL TODAY<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
BUT ANDY'S RIGHT<br />
THE GOOD OLD DAYS<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
NEVER STAY<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID<br />
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE<br />
BUT DOES THAT MEAN WE CANT BE BOYS ANYMORE?<br />
<br />
    <br />
    Page 72<br />
WILL<br />
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING<br />
<br />
THAT I COULD BE LOSING YOU<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
NOBODY IS LOSING<br />
<br />
EVERYONE'S JUST GROWING TOO<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHAT IF THIS WAS NEVER RIGHT<br />
AND IT TOOK US UP UNTIL TONIGHT <br />
TO REALIZE WE'D BEEN SAVING FACE<br />
AND ADMIT WE ARE OUT OF PLACE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
DON'T FIGHT TO FIGURE OUT<br />
<br />
SOMETHING WE'LL ALL JUST LAUGH ABOUT<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I AM NOT READY TO STOP BEING A KID<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
WELL NOBODY SAID THAT WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
WE'LL NEVER BE WHO WE WERE BEFORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT NEVER SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BOYS...<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
(tradeoff)<br />
<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
<br />
(A long silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
God I hate this place. Why couldn't we have gone to Andy's and watched Ella Enchanted? (beat) I'm gonna go.  You want a ride?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, that's okay.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You sure?<br />
<br />
Page 73<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah...I think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
All right. We're gonna be okay. I promise.<br />
<br />
(SKIP starts to exit.)<br />
<br />
Oh I almost forgot.<br />
<br />
(SKIP pulls a key out of his pocket and tosses it to WILL)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You found it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) Thanks.<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Hey. I love you, ok?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know. I love you too.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Night buddy.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
    Night man.<br />

<br />
MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
<br />
<br />
Page 74<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />
CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
<br />

GLORY DAYS<br />
A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
<br />
RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench.)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
<br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
Page 1<br />
  <br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL pulls his notebook out of his backpack)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write)<br />
<br />
YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO <br />
<br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
Who're you talking to...? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
(imitating) Heyyy buddy!!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />

SKIP<br />

<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You like? I'm just letting nature do its thing.<br />

WILL<br />
(amused) You look like a girl.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, you wanna start already? Cause we can go, Tub Tubs!<br />

  <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 Wanna go? Let's go! Who's a girl now? Huh? Who's a girl now Tub Tubs? Wanna cry?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'm joking! No. Okay, okay! No, no, no. I'm sorry. Cut it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HEY, look, if you don't stop I'm not gonna tell you what we're doing tonight!<br />

SKIP<br />
(stops) What we're doing? I thought this was it.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Nope. I've got a plan. Tell me -<br />
Page 3<br />
  <br />

SKIP<br />

WILL<br />
ARE YOU READY TO MAKE HISTORY? <br />

YOU AND ME <br />

HOPING YOU'RE READY <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What are we doing?  <br />
<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(coyly) Cause... I don't know if I trust you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />

WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT<br />

AND WHEN WE ARE, YOU'LL FINALLY SEE<br />
"WHAT THIS HIGH SCHOOL MEANS TO ME"<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
HOW 'BOUT A HINT?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 HOW 'BOUT WE WAIT FOR ALL THE GUYS<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'LL ACT LIKE I'M STILL SURPRISED!<br />
Page 4<br />
  <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
FINE. DO YOU LIKE WATER RIDES?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Are we going to Sea World?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />

<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope. But close.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 I hate you. (beat) Is it something -?<br />
WILL <br />
<br />
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS<br />
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO<br />
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO<br />
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU<br />
<br />
(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?<br />
  <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Superman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) Fuck that!<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Jaaaack!<br />
Page 5<br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
Wiiill! What's up Holmes!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What's up Skillet!?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(sees SKIP) Hey, who's the hippie?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, nice to see you too.<br />
<br />
(Without missing a beat, ANDY tries to get SKIP's opinion on the whole Batman vs. Superman debate.)  <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
(to JACK)ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST YEAR!<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
(looking around)I GOTTA SAY IT'S PRETTY WEIRD <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HOW WAS LIFE AT SCHOOL?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
PROBABLY THE SAME AS YOU<br />

WILL <br />
THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S TRUE UNLESS YOU ROOMED WITH ANDY TOO.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to ANDY) Drop it -<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU THINK THAT BATMAN<br />
<br />
WOULD LOSE A BATTLE TO A GUY IN TIGHTS? <br />
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THOSE GAY RED UNDIES <br />
HE WEARS OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN <br />
TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN<br />
    Page 6<br />
<br />
  <br />
BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT <br />
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What's your point?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sooo... ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />

<br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I said I was sorry!  I'm sorry!<br />
    <br />
(WILL runs over to his backpack)<br />
    <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Slobbers? What was he doing?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I was not! <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Slobbering all over the sofa. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Whatever man! My sister was watching it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh yeaaah, how's she doing? <br />
<br />
(JACK laughs)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to SKIP)  Don't start man -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What!? I'm genuinely interested!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(suspicious) She's fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
She's twelve years old!<br />
    <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Hey, whatever floats your boat, right?<br />
Page 8<br />
  <br />
ANDY<br />
(to JACK) My sister is not allowed to float anyone's boat!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Aww, you're no fun.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
But your sister is!<br />
<br />
SKIP and JACK<br />
OHHHHHHH!!(raspberry<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP and JACK slap high five)<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
(grabbing at SKIP and JACK)<br />
Come here!<br />
    <br />
(ANDY chases SKIP and JACK around the field)<br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
What? Take it as a compliment. You've got good genes!<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
I swear to God-<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY! (WILL throws his arms around ANDY to hold him back. Andy continues to struggle)<br />
    <br />
(to ANDY)Chill! Look, we've got important business to take care of - <br />
<br />
<br />
    (ANDY stops struggling and WILL releases him.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
I got you later! <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh yeah?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, I do!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(scolding) Okay, enough! Here. Read.<br />
<br />
(WILL hands ANDY a newspaper clipping)<br />
Page 9<br />
<br />
  <br />
ANDY<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Just read!<br />
<br />
(ANDY takes a look at the paper. Clears his throat and reads)<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(reading)"Come one, come all to the Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." The FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Keep reading!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside) mmmGAY! ... "take on the illustrious Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend."<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
    Wow, "illustrious", that was a big word!<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I know! (to WILL) What the hell is this?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This,my friend, is inspiration.<br />
<br />
(WILL takes the paper from ANDY and walks back towards the player's bench)<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? <br />
Page 10<br />
  <br />
SKIP<br />
Oh God....<br />
<br />
(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox) <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please. <br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
Ah, hell yeah!(ANDY begins drum roll)<br />
    <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Matt Hoffman, Chris Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - <br />
    <br />
JACK<br />
No shit!? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Is it Jesus?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. Better. You see that box?<br />
<br />
(WILL points to a small weather box situated near the players bench)<br />
ANDY<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Skip?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Uh-huh. Box. Got it.<br />
<br />

That box contains something truly magical. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. <br />
<br />
(WILL tosses the key to ANDY)<br />

(gets it) Fucking genius!<br />
<br />
JACK <br />
I don't get it.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(amazed. To WILL) We're gonna soak the bastards!<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Why?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 Cause it's funny as shit!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we got walked on or treated like we didn't matter. This is karma at its finest boys! <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Blown! My mind is officially blown. <br />
<br />
(SKIP takes the key from ANDY) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We've waited for this moment for five years and tomorrow it's on. All we have to do is reset the timer.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(extends his hand to WILL) Well done sir!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(shakes ANDY's hand) Ah thank you sir!<br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
How did you even get this?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I have my sources.<br />

Look, it doesn't matter how I got it! The fact is I got it! So come on let's do this! (motions the guys towards the box)   <br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
Why're you being so weird?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'm not. It's just not important.<br />
<br />
    ANDY<br />
  Will, you have to tell us.<br />

  Come on...<br />

ANDY<br />
FAT PAT!?<br />

SKIP<br />
Who?<br />

WILL<br />
(to SKIP, referencing ANDY) Exactly why I didn't want to tell you!<br />

ANDY<br />
You don't remember PAT!? Sophomore? Redhead? She's the janitor's niece. Kinda ... thick?<br />

WILL<br />
Andy - <br />

ANDY<br />
What!?<br />

WILL<br />
Don't call her thick!<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
I'm creating a visual.<br />

JACK<br />
(to WILL) Wait, is this the girl who asked you to homecoming, but you said no for religious reasons? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That's the one!<br />

  <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Why'd she give it to you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(a slight hesitation) Cause she was being nice.<br />
<br />
   <br />
ANDY<br />
(joking) Yeah right! What'd you do, take her out on a date?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) No, it wasn't a - (stops mid sentence. Catches himself)<br />

WILL<br />
Huh?<br />

ANDY<br />
It wasn't a what?<br />

ANDY<br />
 Oh sweet Lord Jesus NO! (beat) You DID!<br />

WILL<br />
No I - No. (pause) It wasn't a date.<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
(hardly controlling himself) Then what was it?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We just went out to eat.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
To EAT!? That's an operation. Where'd you take her, Cracker Barrel? No wait! No no wait I got it - it's coming to me - where would you take her so no one would see you AND your Jew ass could feed her for cheap -<br />
<br />
    <br />
    WILL<br />
  Half jew!<br />

ANDY<br />
    Shhh, I'm thinkin'... Denny's! (no response from WILL) Yes!!! I knew it! What'd she get? I have to know.<br />

WILL<br />
    You're a jerk, you know that?<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
Ah come on man. I'm just playing! Look, I'm really proud of you! She's a catch.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Definitely.<br />
<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
She's not a catch and you know it!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cause she's...<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
...Fat? That's fucked up Will.<br />
<br />
(SKIP and JACK laughs at this)<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
 I didn't say that. You're the one calling her fat!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is she's a sure thing. (putting his arm around WILL) And Will, buddy, you need to start taking advantage of these opportunities. Cause let's be honest, you didn't really get any this year.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(pushing ANDY away) Just cuz I didn't want any of the diseased skanks that you and your frat brothers hooked up with doesn't mean I didn't get any.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What are you talking about? Those girls were prime real estate!<br />

SKIP<br />
Woah, woah, woah. I'm sorry. You joined a frat? <br />

ANDY<br />
ME? WHY!?<br />

Cause it goes against everything we stand for.<br />

SKIP<br />
And it's just lame.<br />

ANDY<br />
You're lame!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Isn't that kinda like buying your friends? <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(offended) No! It's about a brotherhood.  A fellowship! A bond! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That you pay for.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Whatever man, all I know is I was getting some high quality poon this year while you were sitting alone in the room jerkin the gherkin! <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I was not.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh really? Why don't you tell Jack and Skip how many girls you boofed?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
They don't care. Now can we just set off some damn-<br />

SKIP<br />

  Well I'll tell you! The answer is zero. None! Nada! He ain't got no game.<br />

That's not true. <br />

Shut up dude!<br />

ANDY<br />
Whatever, I was a great roommate.<br />

I wouldn't want to live with you. <br />

WILL<br />
Can you imagine if the four of us had lived together? I mean what if we had all actually gone to the same school?<br />

ANDY<br />
That would've been tight! The four of us in a suite, trading bitches like Pokemon cards!<br />

JACK<br />
Sorry for ruining your dream.<br />

WILL<br />
I mean, just think of all the stuff we could've pulled on a college campus. <br />

Yeah, but you were so nervous. "I dunno guys, maybe we should abort..."<br />

To be fair, his dad is pretty frightening.<br />

ANDY<br />
Yea, but who says abort?<br />

My dad's in the military, jackass!<br />

God damn it FAT PAT! <br />

Can you call her?<br />

What? No!<br />

Why not?<br />

You call her!<br />

Why the hell would I call her? She's your girlfriend!<br />

She is not, shut up!<br />

Look, stop being a pussy. (ANDY takes out his phone) If she got em mixed up then she can bring over the right one-<br />

WILL<br />
No, its gonna give her the wrong idea.<br />

ANDY<br />
Just tell her to put down the pork chops and get over here-<br />

I'm not doing it!<br />

Well I guess we can't do the prank then.<br />

Why don't we try hanging out for a change? You ever think of that?<br />

ANDY<br />
We are.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally together in the same place. Isn't that enough? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(beat) Sorry.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Think about it. We don't have to associate ourselves with this place ever again, so why do you wanna come back and pull some stupid prank? We're past that.<br />

What message is that?<br />

Page 26<br />
  <br />
WILL<br />
That we deserve respect.<br />

SKIP<br />
From who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
From them!<br />
<br />

SKIP<br />
Oh that makes a ton of sense. (beat) Will. You really think they're gonna start respecting us for setting off sprinklers during their little charity football game?<br />

WILL<br />
It's not about that - it's.... (beat) Come on, don't you think they deserve it!<br />

JACK<br />
Will it was five years ago!<br />

WILL<br />
So!? It still happened! And all because we didn't make their precious little team -<br />

SKIP<br />
Here we go.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
But Will, they're not gonna care. They never did, so why would they start now?<br />

WILL<br />
Then maybe, it's not about them! Maybe it's about us!<br />

EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T COLD<br />
CAUSE ERIC SPENCER SAID THEY ALL KNEW WHAT IT MEANT<br />
AND IF I DIDN'T <br />
I'D LOOK LIKE A TOOL<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
THAT'S WHAT I USED TO THINK<br />
<br />
RIGHT WHEN I WAS ON THE BRINK<br />
OF BEING JUST ANOTHER KINK IN THEIR SOCIAL REGIME<br />
BUT MY LIFE GOT TURNED AROUND <br />
WHEN I FOUND I GOT CUT FROM THEIR FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
<br />
RIGHT HERE WAS THE FIRST PLACE I FELT HOME<br />
WITH NO FEAR OF MY LIFE SPENT ALL ALONE <br />
IT WAS CLEAR UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS <br />
THAT NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAID FROM OVER THERE <br />
<br />
THIS FIELD WAS OURS <br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
(sarcastic) Well that's touching.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Come on man, you used to love this stuff.<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
Used to! I'd like to think I've changed a little since I left this place.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, this place made us who we are! <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
YOU WISH<br />
<br />
YOU'D NEVER CHANGE<br />
AND YOU'D ALWAYS BE IN THAT SAME EPIC MOMENT<br />
BUT YOU MOVED AWAY<br />
AND YOU CAN PRAY THAT THEY'LL STAY<br />
BUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS SAY GOODBYE<br />
AND SORRY, YOU ARE DIFFERENT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! WE ARE STILL YOUNG<br />
<br />

 OF THE COOL PEOPLE'S BULLSHIT<br />
 THE BRUISES TO PROVE THAT IT STUNG ARE STILL HERE<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Will?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(sigh) Fine. I'll call her.<br />
<br />
(WILL takes out his phone and dials)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That's my boy. Take one for the team!<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'm always taking one for the team. (into the phone) Hi, Patty? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'm sorry... Patty?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
HAHA! FATTY PATTY!<br />
<br />
<br />
(Throughout WILL's phone call ANDY does everything he can to distract him. Sexual sounds, etc.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(glares at SKIP) It's Will! Hi. I'm fine. Listen, I'm calling because there seems to have been a bit of a mix up. The key that you gave me doesn't work. Yeah, nope.  So I was just wondering if there was any possibility - (beat) Oh, really!? No, that would be amazing! Thank you. (beat) Uh... Friday?<br />
Page 30<br />
<br />
  <br />
ANDY<br />
(giving it to Friday and hard) Oh yeah, Friday!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Umm... I'm actually kinda busy then... (looking to the guys for help)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
No you're not...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(looking to the guys for help) I just -I got in a car accident yesterday, so... I'm injured. Injured bad. <br />
<br />
(SKIP, ANDY and JACK start laughing)<br />
<br />
Yea I'll be okay, just broke a few bones. Sure. Yeah just give me a call back okay. Great! Thanks!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
What was that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cover.<br />
<br />
JACK <br />
What'd she say?<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
<br />
She's babysitting right now, so she's going to look and see what she can find. She said she'd call me back.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
So we're just waiting?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I guess so.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Dammit.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I feel like we should have brought a board game or something.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Like Jenga!?<br />
<br />
Page 31<br />
  <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Jenga's not a board game!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I was thinking more along the lines of like Monopoly.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I hate Monopoly.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
You would.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is that supposed to mean?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You're just not a Monopoly kinda guy. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yea, cuz I hate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, I think it's more that you don't get it.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh I get it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you've acquired. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Thank you for admitting it.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
My roommate started a board game club in our dorm room this year. Didn't even ask me.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
What a dick! What games?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Just one. Clue.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Ohhh Lord. I can only imagine the people who wanted to join that club.<br />
    Page 32<br />
  <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Actually there were only five kids who kept coming back, but Jesus Christ they were annoying. They called themselves "the Clue Crew."<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That's freakin weird dude. Your roommate sounds worse then Will.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Bite me.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He was fine. I only had to put up with him for a little while.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Did he get kicked out?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No...<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Cause this kid on our floor got kicked out for smoking weed in his room. (to WILL) Remember Stevey?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Smart kid too ... he tried to create this like ventilation system out his window so the RA couldn't smell it. But somebody saw the smoke outside and called the fire department. Now he goes to community college. Fuckin' sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to JACK) What happened to him?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Your roommate... The Clue Meister.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Then why did you only put up with him for a little while?<br />
Page 33<br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
I didn't see him as much.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Just cause.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Wow, you're being awfully descriptive.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Well... (pause) I don't know. Ok. Actually I left before the semester ended. So....<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) What? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Woah, woah, woah. Hold the phone... what did you do? <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I left.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Just...left?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Where did you go?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I took a road trip.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
GET OUT! <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
That's awesome! <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why didn't you tell us?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. It wasn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Are you shitting me?! That's huge!<br />
Page 34<br />
<br />
  <br />
SKIP<br />
How long were you gone?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
A little over a month... I got back like three weeks ago.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Wow, that's awesome! I'm jealous.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Wait...you've been home for three weeks? Why didn't you call us? (referencing ANDY too) We've been here.  <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I know. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I thought you were still at school. Did you not want us to know you were back?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just needed some time alone.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Well, I don't care, I wanna know everything! Where'd you go? What'd you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Everything?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay...<br />
<br />
THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL<br />
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP<br />
<br />
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You kissed your Mom Dude? Gross...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR<br />
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT<br />
BUT I DIDN'T CARE<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />
<br />
Page 35<br />
  <br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />

ANDY<br />
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG<br />
YOU ALWAYS SEE THE UPSIDE<br />
WHY?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
CAUSE I CAN STILL SEE HIM WHEN I LOOK AT HIS FACE<br />
HE'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT, HE'S JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE<br />
<br />
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY<br />
CAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE<br />
WHY GREET THAT CHANGE BY CAUSING HIM PAIN?<br />

ANDY<br />
I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM<br />

THINGS ARE DIFFERENT, WILL<br />
THINGS HAVE CHANGED<br />
JACK IS NO LONGER WITH US<br />
ONLY THE SURFACE REMAINS<br />
NOW ITS JUST YOU AND ME <br />
AND SKIP.  WE'LL WORK AS THREE<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
YOU'RE NOT<br />
WRONG, BUT...<br />
THIS ISN'T WRONG ANDY, THIS IS JUST NEW<br />
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU CANT LOVE HIM<br />
JACK NEVER SAID THAT YOU HAD TO LIVE<br />
YOUR LIFE ONE WAY<br />
LET GO OF YOUR BIAS, HE IS YOUR FRIEND <br />
OR THIS COULD BE<br />
<br />
            <br />
WILL AND ANDY<br />
NOT FOUR ANYMORE<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy -<br />

ANDY<br />
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME TO DO?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
LET IT GO<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
IS THIS FOR HIM OR FOR YOU?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
JUST LET IT GO<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING THIS ON ME <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK, IM NOT SAYING I DISAGREE<br />

Fine.<br />

SKIP<br />
The pride parade is back!<br />

(JACK and SKIP set the cases on the player's bench.)<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What did you get?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Only the best for my boys! Natty Light!<br />
<br />
(SKIP tosses a can of Natty Light to WILL)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(sarcastic) Mmm... Did you steal these from your Dad's fridge?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Nope! (proudly) Bought em.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
How?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
THIS guy!<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP flashes a fake ID)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Let me see that.<br />
<br />
(SKIP hands the ID to WILL)<br />
SKIP<br />
(recites the info from memory) Julio Mendez. 5225 Ridgemont Court. Ironwood, Minnesota.   September 7th, 1983.<br />
<br />
Page 42<br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
Impressive.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I know.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This looks nothing like you.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Sure it does!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This kid is Hispanic. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well it worked didn't it?<br />
<br />
(SKIP takes his ID away from WILL)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(grabbing a beer) You know, I didn't have a single drop of alcohol this past year, and guess what, I'm still sane.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah but you're gay. See what sobriety can do to you? <br />
<br />
(Awkward silence. Musical Break.)<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(WILL, covering, takes a sip.) This stuff is terrible!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Then don't drink it.<br />
Page 43<br />
  <br />
WILL<br />
Just saying, I thought you had better taste then this.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Listen, I had ten dollars.  For ten dollars, this is quality.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
    Touche.<br />
<br />
(Awkward silence. Musical Break.)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
(to WILL) Did what's her face call?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
How long are we gonna to wait around for this girl?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I don't know. You got places to be?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, I just don't wanna be out here all night! That's all!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Amen to that.<br />
<br />
(Awkward silence. Musical Break.) <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to JACK, about SKIP) So what do you think of this new look?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I wasn't gonna say anything but, you kinda look like a pothead. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I think he looks like a woman. <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL and JACK laugh at this)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You know what? I don't really care if it looks good or not. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You should.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Why? Who am I trying to impress?<br />
<br />
Page 44<br />
  <br />
ANDY<br />
Not us, apparently. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised. I thought you were gonna come back looking like a total Ivy Leauge prep. You know, pink polo with the popped collar...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Never! My roommate was like that. He wore plaid shorts every day of the week. It'd be 15 degrees outside and he'd still be wearing plaid shorts and boat shoes. Dumbass.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sounds like your kind of guy.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Not to mention the fact that his dad bought him a Lexus when he graduated from high school. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Jesus.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I got a check from my grandma that bounced.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah. And he was all pissed off cause it wasn't a Beamer. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Shut up!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
So what did you say?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
To him - about the car.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What was I supposed to say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, a guy like that - I figured you'd let him have it.<br />
Page 45<br />
  <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Why would I "let him have it?" Nothing I'm gonna say is going to change anything, so why waste the energy?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
...When you can just grow your hair out.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Exactly!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Are you kidding me?! <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I've just never heard of you backing down from an opportunity like that. You're the most opinionated guy I know.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
My opinion doesn't mean shit Will! It's just one opinion. So why not go with the flow? I mean I'm doing your prank, aren't I?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
It's not my prank! It's OUR prank!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Right. I forgot. Sorry. My point is who cares.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What does that mean, who cares?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I mean no one really listens to anyone anyway, they're all too wrapped up in themselves. So why should I be any different?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Because you are. You always have been. It's why we're friends.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I thought we were friends because we sucked at football.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. We're friends because we're - <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Different? No we're not. You'd like to think we are. But you're sitting here, talking about how things should change. And not doing shit. Just like everybody else.<br />

Am I wrong?<br />

WE COMPLAIN ABOUT OUR PERFECT LIVES WITH BIGGER WORDS THAN MOST<br />
WE SPEW OUT FACTS AND FIND IT RELAXING TO TALK SHIT AS WE BOAST <br />
ABOUT ME AND ME AND ME AND ME, LET'S ALL RAISE A TOAST <br />
<br />
TO THE GENERATION THAT'LL TURN THIS NATION <br />
FROM A SUPERPOWER INTO A GHOST <br />
<br />
OUR FATHERS ARE COMMUTERS, BUT WE'RE STUCK IN OUR COMPUTERS <br />
 WHICH TAKE US ALL AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER, BUT WHO CARES<br />
CUZ WE'RE TOO OCCUPIED TO NOTICE WHAT WAS THERE HAS DIED <br />
BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WHO USED TO LOVE EACH OTHER, CUZ WHO CARES<br />
THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD WE'RE IN WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT HERE<br />

AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY AFTER ALL<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I ONLY HAD MYSELF<br />
TO GUIDE MY LIFELESS ACTION FIGURES TO THE FLOOR, DOWN FROM THE SHELF<br />
MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY<br />
THAT I WOULD FIND SOME REAL FRIENDS TO GUIDE ME SOMEDAY<br />

AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY<br />
<br />
THEY'VE ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS ON ALL THE THINGS WE SAID WE LOVED<br />
CAUSE EVERYONE'S DECIDED THAT THIS ISNT WHAT IT WAS<br />
<br />
WELL NOBODY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT WE'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE<br />
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IM THE ONE WHO'S STILL THE SAME<br />
AND NOW<br />
<br />
I AM STILL ALONE WITH ALL THESE FRIENDS OF MINE<br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME WHO RAN AWAY IN TROUBLED TIMES<br />
AND NOW I FEEL THE SHAME OF HOLDING ONTO WHAT'S NO LONGER MINE<br />
MAYBE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AFTER ALL<br />
AND I JUST NEVER SAW IT AT ALL<br />

Look, could you not. It's private- <br />

Private? Like...a diary?<br />

It's not a diary!<br />

Well then you won't mind if I read it.  (reading) "I stared in awe at a row of glistening bottles on the top shelf, with names like Southern Comfort, Bristol Cream, and Wild Turkey. I chose the Comfort, and the boys dared me to take the first sip. " (to WILL) What is this? <br />

<br />
WILL<br />
It's nothing, okay?<br />

Is this about us? <br />

Maybe. (beat)  Yeah.<br />

(reading) "Jack Moyer was incredibly small for his age and was constantly teased about it. During the first week of school, he had been targeted by a group of seniors who periodically stuffed him in one of the trashcans on the 2nd floor. By the time he'd get to eighth period he was covered in pencil shavings and smelled like chocolate milk." <br />

But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other." <br />

That's not a number, Jack.<br />

(WILL sits up) Seriously though, how many kids have filed in and out of this building over the years, like it was a goddamn assembly line. I mean, how many kids do you think have sat out on these bleachers? Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! (Points to where Andy is sitting)<br />
<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." <br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who they are. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...and even then there are probably thousands of Chris' and Amanda's. <br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I bet Amanda's hot. Just saying.<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
There are so many people just like us, who have sat out here, worrying about their futures. Trying to figure out how they fit into the world and hoping that they're special enough, but not sure if they are. <br />
Page 59<br />
  <br />
There's something about being out here though, like some cosmic pull from the universe telling you you're capable of doing something extraordinary. If you can figure out what that is.<br />

SKIP<br />

Pull from the universe? You sound like a comic book.<br />

WILL<br />
She doesn't know, but now she's pretty sure it's in there.<br />

I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
Page 64<br />

  <br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />

JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />

WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? I mean, was it something that you always knew or...<br />

JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I mean, I wanna know what it's like. What you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Well... I think I always kinda knew on some level. I just fought it and then I realized I didn't have to. I could actually be whi I am and if people don't like who I am then fuck them. I'm fine..<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, beat)<br />

Does that bother you?<br />

WILL<br />
No, of course not.<br />

WILL<br />

I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
Page 65<br />
  <br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
Page 66<br />
  <br />
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />

WILL<br />

A THING ABOUT<br />

WILL, SKIP AND JACK<br />
  FORGET ABOUT IT<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
NO!<br />
IT'S SO EASY, WILL<br />
DON'T HOLD IT IN <br />
SAY YOU'RE A FAGGOT JUST LIKE HIM <br />
<br />
(silence)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
(disbelief) What did you just say?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I didn't mean it like that... I just... <br />
<br />
OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
JACK<br />
(to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
<br />
SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(overlapping)<br />
...LOOK WHO'S "SPEAKING OUT"<br />
LIKE HE KNOWS ABOUT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
JUST PUT THE BLAME ON ME<br />
THEN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
 WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE I GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
DONT FUCK WITH OTHER<br />
UNLESS THEY WANT TO LOSE EACH OTHER<br />
WELL, YOU JUST LOST ME<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
YOU DON'T CARE HOW I FEEL<br />
SO WHY SHOULD I CARE WHAT I SAY TO YOU?<br />
NO, I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
DON'T FUCK WITH EACH OTHER<br />
 <br />
(Silence.)<br />
    <br />
JACK<br />
And now you have nothing to say? (beat) Kay. I'll go.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Jack- <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No. It's okay.<br />
<br />
(JACK exits)<br />
Page 74<br />
  <br />
SKIP<br />
Why would you say that to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I wasn't calling him that!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
He's supposed to be one of your best friends and you treat him like he wronged you. He did nothing to you. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Skip -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
You just fucked up a friendship for all of us because you're too selfish to get that it's not always about YOU!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Can I please say something?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No! Everything that's coming out of your mouth tonight is toxic, and I'm tired of listening to it. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I would never call him -<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, stop -<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
No! (to SKIP) It's not about him being gay, Skip, it's about -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I don't wanna hear it! No one does -<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Skip -<br />
<br />
MY TURN<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY... THE THING IS<br />
THAT ANDY...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
IS HE'S THE ONE TALKING<br />
SO SHUT THE FUCK UP<br />
WHY ANDY?<br />
IT'S ALL ABOUT "ANDY"<br />
BUT NOBODY LETS ME SPEAK!<br />
Page 75<br />
  <br />
WHEN I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIT IN <br />
AND BE LIKE YOU WANT ME TO BE<br />
<br />
TRYING TO BE LIKE YOU<br />
BUT I GUESS YOU CANT CHANGE...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DONT REALLY CARE WHEN YOU ARE THAT UNFAIR TO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY, PLEASE CALM DOWN, THERE'S...<br />
<br />
SKIP and WILL<br />
<br />
OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.....<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
THAT INCLUDES ME TOO, YOU GUYS!<br />
YOU CANT JUST ERASE ME<br />
IM SORRY THIS FIGHT HAD TO CHANGE YOUR NIGHT<br />
BUT THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS FACE ME<br />
<br />
YOU CAN'T KEEP LYING TO YOURSELF<br />
AND HOPE YOU'LL FORGET IT<br />
<br />
LYING TO KEEP US CLOSE<br />
BUT IT WENT TO SHIT CAUSE YOU LET IT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Listen -<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
NO! IT IS MY TURN TO LET ME TALK<br />
IF YOU DON'T<br />
I'LL TAKE MY TURN TO TELL THE TRUTH<br />
<br />
IF YOU WON'T<br />
IM NOT SAYING JACK WAS WRONG, OR IM THE ONE WHO'S RIGHT<br />
BUT IT IS MY TURN TO SAY MY PIECE TONIGHT<br />
<br />
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WILL<br />
LOOK AROUND<br />
YOUR GOOD OLD GLORY DAYS<br />
ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND<br />
<br />
(ANDY picks up the notebook up off the bleachers)<br />
<br />
<br />
AND ALL OF THESE MEMORIES WE USED TO ENJOY<br />
THE NIGHTS OUT HERE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE<br />
THE BROTHERS THAT NO ONE COULD EVER DESTROY<br />
WERE WORTH NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING!!<br />
<br />
(ANDY tears the notebook apart.)<br />
Page 76<br />
  <br />
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOYS?<br />
<br />
NOW IT IS MY TURN TO ASK YOU<br />
WHAT TO DO?<br />
<br />
WHEN AFTER FIVE YEARS <br />
I DON'T TRUST YOU<br />
WE'VE BEEN BROTHERS FOR SO LONG<br />
AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE - <br />
<br />
SO IT IS MY TURN - <br />
<br />
<br />
IT IS MY TURN<br />
TO GO<br />
BUT IT IS YOUR TURN<br />
TO KNOW <br />
I'VE NEVER HAD A GIFT LIKE YOURS FOR CLEVER WORDS TO SAY<br />
BUT NOW IT'S MY TURN AND I DONT WANT THEM ANYWAY<br />
<br />
(ANDY exits.)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Andy -<br />
<br />
(WILL, near tears, is on the ground, trying to piece together his journal)<br />
 <br />
What was he talking about? You lied to him?<br />
Page 77<br />
  <br />
WILL<br />
No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything, cause I didn't want anything to get fucked up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing anyways?  Something you wanna tell me?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know.<br />
(WILL continues to pick up the pieces of the notebook)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.<br />
<br />
(SKIP kneels down to help)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, maybe not.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know, but when the hell did that happen?<br />
Page 78<br />
  <br />
SKIP<br />
Good question.<br />
<br />
BOYS<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN WE WERE BOYS<br />
WE HAD FUN<br />
AND BLAMED MISTAKES ON BEING HUMAN<br />
<br />
BUT NOW WE'RE OLD<br />
AND EVEN ONE<br />
WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN<br />
<br />
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT ALL OF US DID<br />
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER WE WERE SO SURE<br />
THAT WE'D NEVER STOP BEING BOYS ANYMORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU THINK IS DEAD<br />
YOU'RE WHINING LIKE YOUR LIFE IS OVER<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT FEELS THAT WAY<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT NO ONE SAID<br />
YOU CANT SCREW UP WHEN YOU GET OLDER<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WE WERE SO PERFECT TIL TODAY<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT ANDY'S RIGHT<br />
THE GOOD OLD DAYS<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
NEVER STAY<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID<br />
<br />
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE<br />
BUT DOES THAT MEAN WE CANT BE BOYS ANYMORE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING<br />
Page 79<br />
  <br />
THAT I COULD BE LOSING YOU<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
NOBODY IS LOSING<br />
EVERYONE'S JUST GROWING TOO<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHAT IF THIS WAS NEVER RIGHT<br />
AND IT TOOK US UP UNTIL TONIGHT <br />
TO REALIZE WE'D BEEN SAVING FACE<br />
AND ADMIT WE ARE OUT OF PLACE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
DON'T FIGHT TO FIGURE OUT<br />
SOMETHING WE'LL ALL JUST LAUGH ABOUT<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
ONE DAY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I AM NOT READY TO STOP BEING A KID<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
WELL NOBODY SAID THAT WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
WE'LL NEVER BE WHO WE WERE BEFORE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT NEVER SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BOYS...<br />
<br />
WILL and SKIP<br />
<br />
(tradeoff)<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
ANYMORE<br />
    <br />
(A long silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
God I hate this place. Why couldn't we have gone to Andy's and watched Ella Enchanted? (beat) I'm gonna go.  You want a ride?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, that's okay.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You sure?<br />
Page 80<br />
  <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah... I think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
All right. We're gonna be okay. I promise.<br />
<br />
(SKIP starts to exit.)<br />
<br />
Oh I almost forgot.<br />
<br />
(SKIP pulls a key out of his pocket and tosses it to WILL)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You found it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) Thanks.<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Hey. I love you, ok?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know. I love you too.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Night buddy.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
 Night man.<br />
<br />
(SKIP exits.)<br />
<br />
MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
Page 81<br />
<br />
  <br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />
Page 82<br />
  <br />
<br />
CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)<br />
<br />
THE END.<br />
