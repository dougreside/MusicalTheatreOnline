(A night in May; unusually cool out. The Sturmsville High School football field, home of the Sturmsville Stallions. Williamson Henry, 19, enters wearing a jacket and carrying a backpack.)<br />
<br />
TURN AROUND<br />
         <br />
         WILL<br />
TURN AROUND<br />
 TURN AWAY FROM TEMPTING ROADS THAT LEAD YOU ASTRAY<br />
<br />
 TURN AROUND<br />
 TURN AROUND AND YOU JUST MIGHT BE FOUND<br />
         <br />
TURN AROUND<br />
 TURN AWAY FROM RULES THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO OBEY<br />
 TURN AROUND<br />
 TURN AROUND AND YOU JUST MIGHT BE FOUND<br />
<br />
 <br />
(WILL sits down on the bleachers and checks his watch. It's midnight. He opens his backpack and takes out a small notebook. He reads.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
"The cabinet door had been left unlocked... big mistake. The boys stared in awe at a row of half-filled bottles glistening on the top shelf. Will had been explicitly warned against going anywhere near his father's liquor cabinet. He knew the punishment would be severe, somewhere between grounding and death, but it was a risk he was willing to take. Jack kept an eye on the door, while Skip carefully ascended each shelf and returned with a tall brown bottle. Andy tore away the gold seal and dared Will to take the first sip. Just as Will placed the bottle to his lips, he heard the sound of footsteps trudging down the hall. Jack tried to warn them but it was too late."<br />
<br />
(The sound and lights of a car pulling into the parking lot startle Will. He closes his notepad and stuffs it in his backpack. He looks up in anticipation. WILL smiles)<br />
         <br />
         WILL<br />
<br />
          TURN AROUND AND YOU'RE HOME<br />
           WITH THE BEST FRIENDS THAT YOU COULD KNOW<br />
           TURN AROUND AND YOU'RE HOME<br />
           WITH WHO LOVES YOU THE MOST<br />
  TURN AROUND AND YOU'RE HOME<br />
  WITH MEMORIES FROM A LIFETIME AGO<br />
<br />
  THAT ONLY SEEM TO GROW AND GROW AND GROW<br />
 <br />
 (SKIP THOMAS, 19, enters without WILL noticing and puts his hands over WILL's eyes)<br />
 <br />
 SKIP<br />
 Guess who, shit head?<br />
 <br />
<br />
 WILL<br />
 Hey!<br />
 <br />
 (SKIP and WILL hug)<br />
 <br />
 SKIP<br />
 How are you man? It's been a while.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 WILL<br />
Tell me about it. What's up with your hair?<br />
<br />
 SKIP<br />
You like? I'm letting nature do its thing.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You look like a stoner.<br />
 <br />
(SKIP hits him.)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Where is everybody?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
They're on their way. So tell me...<br />
<br />
 <br />
ARE YOU READY <br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
What?<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
ARE YOU READY TO MAKE HISTORY? <br />
RIGHT HERE ON THIS FOOTBALL FIELD <br />
YOU AND ME <br />
AND TWO OTHER GUYS <br />
WHO SHOULD SHOW UP AT ANY TIME <br />
<br />
WHEN EVER THEY DO GET HERE, I'M <br />
HOPING YOU'RE READY<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What are we doing?<br />
<br />
 WILL<br />
I can't say. <br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Why not? <br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I promised Andy I wouldn't tell you anything 'til he got here.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
What are you talking about?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We have a plan.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
What do you mean a plan?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You'll see!<br />
WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT<br />
<br />
 WE ALL WILL BE HERE FINALLY<br />
AND WHEN WE ARE, YOU'LL FINALLY SEE<br />
"WHAT THIS HIGH SCHOOL MEANS TO ME"<br />
 <br />
 SKIP<br />
How bout, like, a little hint?<br />
 <br />
 WILL<br />
<br />
Do you wanna ruin the surprise?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Come on man! Before they get here!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Fine. How do you feel about water rides?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Like at amusement parks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Sort of.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Huh?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS <br />
<br />
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO <br />
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO <br />
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU<br />
<br />
(ANDERSON SCOTT, 19, and JACK RITCHIE, 19, enter, bickering. ANDY is wearing a jacket and carrying a small duffle bag.) <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Fuck that, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets... <br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
True, but could he stop a Batarang?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You don't know! Will, who'd win in a fight, Batman or Superman?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Who cares? Hey Jack!!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Hey!<br />
<br />
 <br />
      (WILL and JACK hug.)<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Who's the hippie?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Nice to see you too.<br />
<br />
 <br />
(SKIP hits ANDY; they hug and start bickering)<br />
<br />
WILL (to JACK)<br />
ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I CANT BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S BEEN AN ENTIRE YEAR<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I GOTTA SAY IT'S PRETTY WEIRD<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HOW WAS LIFE AT SCHOOL?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
PROBABLY THE SAME AS YOU<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S TRUE UNLESS YOU ROOMED WITH ANDY TOO.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to ANDY) Don't start again!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU THINK THAT BATMAN <br />
WOULD LOSE A BATTLE TO A GUY IN TIGHTS?  <br />
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THOSE GAY RED UNDIES  <br />
HE WEARS OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN  <br />
<br />
TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN  <br />
BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT  <br />
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Huh. That's a good point.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HAVE WE EVER STEERED YOU WRONG?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DUNNO. IT'S BEEN SO LONG.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
JUST GET READY FOR TONIGHT <br />
AND WHAT A NIGHT IT'S GONNA BE <br />
YOU AND YOU AND YOU AND ME <br />
FINALLY<br />
<br />
BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'VE MISSED YOU GUYS<br />
<br />
ANDY (to JACK)<br />
YOU ONLY LIKE SUPERMAN CAUSE HE FLIES<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
NOW ARE YOU READY FOR<br />
<br />
 <br />
ALL GUYS<br />
READY <br />
FOR TONIGHT  <br />
RIGHT <br />
HERE!!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
So what is this mysterious plan?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Well... <br />
 <br />
(WILL runs over to his bag)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Prepare to get your minds blown!<br />
<br />
 <br />
(WILL pulls a large set of keys out of his bag and tosses them to SKIP)<br />
<br />
 SKIP<br />
Fascinating. What are these?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
They're keys.<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(sarcastic) Thank you.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
But not just any keys. They're from maintenance, which means we can get into any room in the school plus that little black box over there.<br />
 <br />
(WILL points to a small black weather box near the player's bench)<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What's in there?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Access to the Sturmsville Stallions Brand New State of the Art... Sprinkler System. <br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Fucking genius!<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(sarcastic) Yea, brilliant. What are we, twelve?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I thought we were just hanging out tonight.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No man! We pranked graduation last year. We're doing it again this year!<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'd rather just get drunk.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You would.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
So would you!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
How did you even get these?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
We stole 'em.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
How?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
We went into Abby's house and took 'em.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Abby!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Her dad's a janitor.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Which one?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
The fat one.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Roy.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
I don't remember a Roy.<br />
 <br />
(WILL takes the keys from SKIP)<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
You made a point to get to know every janitor while you were in school?<br />
<br />
 <br />
(WILL walks over to the box and tries each key in the lock.)<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So let me get this straight, you broke into the girl's house!?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Not exactly. It was much deeper than that.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
They don't need to hear this.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh come on, it's a good story! I hooked her and Will up on a little dinner date. Imagine if you will... Will drives to the house. He's got on a nice shirt. He walks up, rings the doorbell, and there's Abby. And she's looking FINE. She's all ready to go out for a night on the town, but, suddenly Will decides he has to "use the bathroom." (to WILL) Tell Skip what you said.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
About what?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
To Abby!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
"May I use your bathroom?"<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
And BANG, he's in the house! So while Abby's showing him the bathroom, I'm sneaking in the front door. I hide in the closet. Will takes a fake leak, all done, they leave, I pull off some 007 shit, grab the keys, and I'm out like magic.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Andy...?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Where was her dad during all this?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
He works a night shift over at Grossman's.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Andy...?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Now seriously, I don't want to toot my own trombone or anything, but you gotta admit that was some impressive shit I pulled off.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(still digging through the keys) Andy, shut up for a second! This won't open.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
What are you talking about?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
The box, it won't open.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You don't have the key.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
What?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I've got it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What the hell do you think I've been doing over here?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I don't know. I've been telling a story.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Jesus Christ. Where is it?<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I got it. (searching his pockets) Somewhere.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
You better have it!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I do, don't wet your pants.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
(to WILL) What happened with Abby?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(sarcastic) Yeah, why don't you tell Skip and Jack "what happened with Abby?"<br />
<br />
 <br />
(ANDY finds the key inside one of his cargo pockets.)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Nothing. (to ANDY) Is that it?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY tosses the key to WILL)<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
What was wrong with her?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Nothing. She was fine, I just didn't have any desire to pursue it.<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Cause he's gay.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Shut up! She's only a junior in high school. <br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(sarcastic) Oh, and that's a big step down for you? You didn't have to date the girl. But you missed out on a great opportunity to get some high quality poon. <br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I didn't want any poon.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
What are you talking about? Everybody wants poon!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Not that poon.<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
What do you mean, "not that poon." When was the last time you got any poon?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Can we stop saying poon?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Why don't you tell Jack and Skip how many girls you hooked up with this year?<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
It's not a competition.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yes it is! They wanna know.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Nobody cares!<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Come on! How many?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Probably like... 15.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
(amazed) Really?<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, really... maybe even 20.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Bullshit!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(proudly lying) It's true.<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
You are such a fucking liar! (to SKIP and JACK) I've been with him the whole year, he hasn't even talked to 15 girls.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
You don't have to talk to 'em when you're doing it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
He's got a point.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
There's no way you hooked up with that many girls.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Don't be hurt.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm not!<br />
 <br />
WE'VE GOT GIRLS<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
D'YOU EVER WONDER WHERE THE FEMALES GO <br />
WHEN THERE'S NO ONE AT THE BAR AND ITS LONELY ON THE DANCE FLOOR? <br />
<br />
THEY'RE IN MY BEDROOM I CAN GUARANTEE <br />
FIGURING OUT HOW TO PLEASE ME<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
D'YOU EVER WONDER WHERE HE GETS THIS SHIT <br />
AND IF ANY OF THE SKANKS THAT HE STALKS BELIEVE A WORD OF IT? <br />
HE NEVER LEARNED HOW TO BE MR. RIGHT <br />
<br />
IM THE WITH ALL THE HOTTIES IN MY BED AT NIGHT<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD HE SAYS <br />
HE HASN'T BEEN KISSED SINCE TRUTH OR DARE<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE? <br />
<br />
WHEN I'M WITH GIRLS YOU'RE NOT THERE <br />
IVE LEARNED WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR <br />
AND YOU DON'T KNOW CAUSE YOU DON'T CARE <br />
IVE GOT GIRLS BY THE BALLS <br />
IVE FIGURED EM OUT AND GOT EM UP AGAINST THE WALL<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING AT ALL <br />
YOU'RE MAKING THIS UP <br />
YOU'D HAVE TO HIDE IN A WOMEN'S BATHROOM STALL <br />
TO GET A GIRL NEAR YOUR BALLS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
YOU THINK YOU'RE MANLY BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH <br />
<br />
TO GET A GIRL TO WANT YOU YOU'VE GOTTA BE MORE THAN TOUGH <br />
THEY WANT A LISTENER AND A PERFECT DATE  <br />
THEN THEY'RE SO STUNNED, THEY DON'T NOTICE WHILE YOU FORNICATE<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
YOU THINK YOU'RE SOMETHING KNOWING ALL THESE RULES <br />
BUT YOU CANT DO MUCH BESIDES YOUR RIGHT HAND WITHOUT THE TOOLS <br />
<br />
GIRLS WANT A BODY THAT IS BIG AND STRONG <br />
AND UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A PENIS PUMP YOU KNOW HAVENT GOT IT LONG <br />
IVE GOT GIRLS BY THE BALLS <br />
IM GETTING EM HOT CAUSE THEY LIKE IT WHEN THEY'RE GUYS ARE TALL<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
YOU'VE GOT SOME KIND OF GALL <br />
<br />
BUT NO KIND OF BRAIN <br />
THE STEROIDS YOU'RE ON MAKE YOUR VITAL ORGANS SMALL <br />
LIKE THE ONE NEXT TO YOUR BALLS<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
THE DORK WHO WENT AND RAISED THE BAR<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
YOU WISH YOU HAD MY LOOKS<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
AND YOU WISH YOU COULD READ A BOOK<br />
 <br />
ANDY AND WILL<br />
<br />
YOU ARE THE OPPOSITE OF ME<br />
IM MORE THAN HAPPY TO AGREE<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
If you've hooked up with so many girls, why are you always jerking off?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Cause your Mom is constantly on my mind.<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Shut up!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah buddy! She likes it forwards, backwards, sideways... and she loves a good old fashioned Donkey Punch!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I'm gonna kill you!<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Hey hey hey cut it out!<br />
 <br />
(SKIP pulls ANDY off of WILL. JACK helps WILL off the ground)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You guys haven't changed a bit.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
You're right, Will's still a lying sack of shit!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
At least I have a sack! Pussy.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY is enraged, and rushes at WILL. SKIP holds him back.)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Knock it off!<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I don't see why you're fighting. You both want the same thing. It's like you're competing to see who's the biggest asshole.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Hey!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(hurt) Shut up!<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
You guys have no respect for women. I mean, don't you two want nice, sane things? Like love?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
OF COURSE WE WANT TO BE IN LOVE <br />
AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR ROMANCE<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
BUT TIL WE FIND THAT LONESOME DOVE<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
WE'LL JUST GET INTO THEIR PANTS<br />
<br />
ANDY AND WILL<br />
WE'VE GOT GIRLS BY THE BALLS <br />
THEY'RE LOOKIN FOR LOVE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE MAKIN AT ALL <br />
WE'VE GOT GIRLS BY THE BALLS AND WE'RE HOLDIN ON <br />
<br />
IT'S TIME FOR EVERY GIRL TO BE GRABBED <br />
BY THE BALLS!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Well, I'm glad to see you guys have grown up.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh... things grew. (points to his crotch)  Like my dong! (laughs)<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
You're an idiot.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I can't believe you guys lived in the same room.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
It was hard sometimes. (points to ANDY) He never showers.<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Shut up dude!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Maybe once a week.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I'm just glad I didn't have to live with you guys.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Hey! Can you imagine if the four of us had actually lived together? I mean, if we all went to the same school?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
People would have died.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Whatever, that would have been tight! The four of us in a suite, trading bitches like Pokemon cards.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Seriously though, think of all the shit we could have pulled off.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah right. On a college campus? We would've gotten expelled so fast.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
At least it would've been a challenge. <br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
You don't think this'll be a challenge?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
This? (WILL waves the key in the air and heads towards the box) This'll be a breeze!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
We'll see.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
What's that supposed to mean?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
I don't think it'll be that easy.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
It's gonna be great! Why do you always have to get so skeptical?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
I do not!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah you do! I thought you were gonna have an aneurism when we stole the diplomas from Covington's office last year.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
That was my idea!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but you were sweatin' beads the whole time.  "I dunno guys, maybe we should abort..." Who says abort? We're not in a Star Trek Movie!<br />
 <br />
(WILL opens the box.)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
We're in!<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(to SKIP) See!? (looks in the box) Oooo, this is fancy. (reaches into the box)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Don't touch. (smacks ANDY's hand) Let's see, we've got... Start Time, Run Time -<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP (to WILL)<br />
We're really gonna do this?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, we're really gonna do this... what's your deal?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Whatever.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(like pulling teeth) What!?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Come on, what do you want to accomplish by screwing with their sprinkler system?<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What do you mean? This is the plan!<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
I know, and I think it's stupid.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh shit... it's got a little computer screen.<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Don't touch! (smacks ANDY's hand again. To SKIP) Why did you even bother coming then?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
I didn't know we were pulling a prank! I wanted to see you guys.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
But this is what we do every year. It's tradition.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
We've done it once. I don't think that qualifies as a tradition.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Well they've gotta start somewhere.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
This is retarded.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Dude, just go home! We don't need your negative ass dragging everything down. The three of us can handle this by ourselves.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. I'm not really feeling it either.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
What? Come on guys this is important!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
How? What exactly do we get out of this?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
For starters, it's funny as fuck.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
It's also illegal.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No! It sends a message.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Which one's that?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
That we deserve respect.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
By drenching an entire field of people you think the school's going to start respecting us?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
It'll make 'em listen.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
They won't even know we did it!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
But we'll know.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Great, so what message does that send?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
That we know who we are despite what other people think of us. That's the reason we became friends in the first place, isn't it?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
No, the reason we became friends was because we didn't care what other people thought of us.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Right, we don't care.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
But don't you see that by doing this, your showing that you do!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No!<br />
 <br />
ASS BACKWARDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG <br />
<br />
DIDN'T YOU HAVE DREAMS THAT YOU LET GO OF <br />
CAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD YOU THAT YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DREAM <br />
THE WAY YOU DO JUST CAUSE YOU WERE DIFFERENT?<br />
  <br />
ANDY<br />
YEA, AND WHO WERE THEY<br />
<br />
ALL THOSE ASSHOLES WHO MESSED WITH US <br />
<br />
THEY NEVER GOT THE BEST OF US <br />
THEY WEREN'T READY TO LET ME BE WHAT IM GONNA BE SO FUCK EM <br />
IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT THAN ME<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
BUT WE ARE STILL YOUNG <br />
AND THOUGH WE MAY HAVE TRIED TO RID OUR LIVES <br />
<br />
OF THE COOL PEOPLE'S BULLSHIT <br />
THE BRUISES TO PROVE THAT IT STUNG ARE STILL HERE <br />
CAUSE WE'RE STILL DIFFERENT<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
SO PLEASE LET'S LET IT BE <br />
CAUSE IF WE HAVENT LET THIS GO <br />
<br />
WE WONT MOVE ON AND WE'LL NEVER GROW <br />
AND IM NOT READY TO BE PROUDLY FAKE FOR OLD TIMES SAKE <br />
IM DIFFERENT <br />
BUT IM NOT THE OLD ME<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
LISTEN, LIFE'S NOT FAIR <br />
<br />
AND WHO KNOWS WHY PEOPLE CHANGE AND PEOPLE LIE <br />
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE THEM WE DON'T HAVE TO ROLL OVER AND DIE <br />
WE CAN TRY <br />
TO BE ASS BACKWARDS <br />
AND GO AGAINST THE GRAIN FROM BEING SO NORMAL <br />
THAT IT MAKES YOU GO INSANE<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL and ANDY<br />
BECAUSE ASS BACKWARDS <br />
IS SEEING OUR LIVES THROUGH DIFFERENT ANGLES <br />
EACH OTHER'S EYES<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Will, this whole thing is really childish.<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You didn't think that last year.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
That prank was stupid too. The next day they printed out new copies of the diplomas.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but they didn't have them for the ceremony.<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
So? Those assholes still graduated. The world didn't spin off its axis. It was a minor inconvenience at best.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Plus we could've been expelled for that.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
But we weren't! Come on, what happened to you guys? You used to love shit like this!<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
YOU THINK YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE <br />
AND YOU'LL NEVER REARRANGE THIS PERFECT PICTURE <br />
BUT YOU'LL MOVE AWAY AND THOUGH YOU PRAY THAT THEY'LL STAY <br />
THE GOOD OLD DAYS SAY GOODBYE AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE DIFFERENT<br />
<br />
WILL AND ANDY<br />
LISTEN, LIFE'S NOT FAIR <br />
<br />
CAUSE TIME GOES BY <br />
PEOPLE CHANGE AND DREAMS GO DRY <br />
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO LET THEM <br />
WE CAN'T FORGET TO LIVE AND THEN DIE<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Come on guys. It's only the sprinklers.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ALL<br />
(WILL starts as the others join in gradually)<br />
WE CAN TRY <br />
TO BE ASS BACKWARDS AND RISE ABOVE THE REST <br />
AND BE ASS BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF BEING THE BEST <br />
ASS BACKWARDS IS SEEING OUR LIVES FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES <br />
EACH OTHER'S EYES<br />
<br />
 <br />
BEING ASS BACKWARDS <br />
AND LEARNING FROM OUR FRIENDS THAT BEING ASS BACKWARDS <br />
MEANS FRIENDSHIP NEVER ENDS <br />
ASS BACKWARDS IS SEEING OUR LIVES FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES <br />
EACH OTHER'S EYES<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
So?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Alright. Fine, let's do it.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Great!<br />
 <br />
<br />
(They all run over to the box)<br />
 <br />
(looking into the box) Let's see. Tomorrow is....?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Thursday.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Right. Okay. It's set to go off at... 1:30 tonight.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Graduation starts at 2:00 tomorrow.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
So we'll set it for 2:30! Sound good?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Works for me.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
2:30 it is. (Starts punching in numbers) Hour...2.... (Pause) Hour...2.  Shit!!<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
What?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
It's got a password.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
No it doesn't!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Yes, Andy, it clearly does.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Where?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
There, where it says "password."<br />
 <br />
(ANDY stares at the screen. Silence)<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't have it, do you?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I didn't fucking know there was one! (beat) Why don't you just type in Stallions or something?<br />
 <br />
(ANDY reaches into the box)<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No! (smacks ANDY's hand away) It's not going to be that simple. They're not idiots. For starters, the pad doesn't even have letters. It's just digits.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Well let's start typing in numbers.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
That's dumb.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
You've got a better idea?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Look, why don't we just go over to Jack's house and watch a movie?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
No -<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oooo... We can watch Channel 85!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I'd rather not spend my evening watching scrambled porn. Look, we can figure this out. We've got the whole night.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
The whole night!?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah! That's what we agreed on.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
What is your problem?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I agree with Skip. Numbers and.... I don't think we're gonna be able to figure this out tonight. Let's just go to Jack's.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I'm glad everyone's inviting themselves over to my house.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Besides I'm supposed to meet up with Beth later.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No way!!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Excuse me?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You can screw around with Beth or anybody else you want the rest of the summer. Tonight is about us.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
But...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(resigned) No - this is more important.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No, Andy. I said no!!<br />
 <br />
(Silence. SKIP and JACK are in awe. Will takes his cell phone out of his pocket and tosses it to ANDY)<br />
 <br />
Tell her you can't make it.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
She's gonna be pissed. I made plans with her like a week ago.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah? Well we've been planning this for a month... so call her, deal with it and let's start having a fucking good time!<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
(taken aback. sotto voce) Yes sir...<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Well, what am I supposed to say?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I don't care. Say you have more important things to do. Say your car blew up on the way over and you're dead. It doesn't matter. She'll believe whatever you say. She's dumb as shit anyway.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Fine. But maybe you should call her.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I will if you want!<br />
 <br />
(JACK laughs)<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Screw you!<br />
 <br />
<br />
(WILL starts to call Chelsea)<br />
<br />
No. I'll do it!<br />
 <br />
(ANDY takes the phone away from WILL, moves upstage)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Idiot.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
(to WILL) So what do you wanna do?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Just let me think.<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
The password has to be written down somewhere, right?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe, but how would we get that?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Well, this is the master key to the building, isn't it?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
So it'll get us into the maintenance closet. And I bet you twenty bucks the password's in there. (beat) Look, it has to be written down. Those guys can't even count to 10, how are they gonna remember a password? I mean it's worth trying! We're running out of ideas.<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(upstage, still talking on the phone) I know. It was terrible. The whole thing just blew up. It was probably a faulty engine- I don't know. Yeah I'm alive. I just broke a few bones. Alright listen, I gotta run - but I'll call you tomorrow. Bye babe.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY turns off his phone and crosses downstage to the guys.)<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
All right! So what's the plan?<br />
<br />
 <br />
(SKIP just shakes his head at ANDY)<br />
<br />
What?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
(to WILL) Here, give me the keys. I'll go see what I can find. Twenty bucks.<br />
 <br />
<br />
(WILL gives the keys to SKIP. SKIP exits.)<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Where's he going?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
To see if he can find the password.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Good idea. (beat) Hey, I almost forgot. Do either of you want a beer? It's not the best stuff, but it's all I could find.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY runs over to the bleachers. He pulls a couple bottles out of his bag.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to ANDY) What kind did you get?<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Blankson's Brew.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Did you steal those from your Dad's fridge?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yup.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
That's sad.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(to JACK) You want one?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
That's all right.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No, thanks.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I know you don't want one. You fuckin' pussy.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY and JACK both laugh and ANDY takes a sip of his beer)<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to JACK) So how was school, man?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I don't know.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
That's it...I don't know?? You've been away for 7 months and that's all you got?<br />
<br />
  <br />
WILL<br />
How was your roommate?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
He was fine. I only had to put up with him for a little while.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Did he get kicked out?<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
No<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Cause this kid on our floor got kicked out for smoking weed in his room. He was a smart kid too... he tried to create this ventilation system out his window, so the RA couldn't smell it. But someone saw the smoke outside and called the fire department. Now he goes to community college. Fuckin' sucks.<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL (to JACK)<br />
How were your grades last semester?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Umm...ok. (pause) I actually left before the semester ended.<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yeah, so I didn't get grades.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Woah, woah, woah, hold the phone... What'd you do?<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I decided to leave.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
You just left?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What'd you do?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I took a road trip.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
GET OUT!<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
That's awesome! You meet any hot bitches?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Not really.<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why didn't you tell us?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. It wasn't a big deal.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Are you shitting me?! That's huge!<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
How long were you gone?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
A little over a month... I got back about two weeks ago.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Wait... you've been home for two weeks? We've been here since the 3rd. Why didn't you call us? <br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Did you not want us to know?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
No, Will, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just needed some time to myself.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Well, I wanna know everything! Where did you go? What did you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Everything?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay...<br />
<br />
THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL <br />
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP <br />
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
You kissed your Mom? Gross...<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR <br />
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT <br />
BUT I DIDN'T CARE <br />
<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY <br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST <br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN <br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO <br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES <br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS <br />
<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE <br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME <br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
 <br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS <br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY <br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY <br />
<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS <br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY <br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY <br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME <br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST <br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW <br />
<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE <br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDE TO POCONOS <br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED <br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE <br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
 <br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES <br />
<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE <br />
SO HE ASKED ME FOR A RIDE<br />
 <br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS <br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT <br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT <br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY <br />
<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND <br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING <br />
WE WERE DRIVING <br />
WE WERE DRIVING <br />
JUST ME <br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY <br />
<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Have you told your parents yet?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
What did they say?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
My mom said she always knew...<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
So did I.<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
...which was so annoying.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Oh. Sorry.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
That's okay.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(pause) Well that's.... great. Wow. I'm sorry. I'm just...I'm really proud of you.<br />
 <br />
(WILL hugs JACK)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Think of it this way, you've already got three great boyfriends. And best of all we split up the duties! That way you'll never get sick of one guy. Skip gives you thought provoking conversation, I organize your day, and Andy gives it to you up the butt.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Stop.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I was just joking.<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
It wasn't funny.<br />
 <br />
(SKIP enters)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Hey! (to JACK) You owe you me twenty bucks! I didn't find shit. (He hands the keys back to WILL. He raises a magazine.) But I did find this Hustler in the closet? It's a classic. Check out the banana titties on page 42. (Tosses the magazine to Jack. Silence) What?<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I'm gay.<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
(He starts to laugh, but realizes that it's not a joke) Really?<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yeah, I just - you missed it.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Oh. Wow. You don't need to hold that. (Takes the magazine from JACK and tosses it) So you're gay? I sort of always knew I think, no offense, you're just not very good at hiding things.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Thanks.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
You're welcome. (silence. SKIP just stares at JACK) I'm sorry. It's just... new.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
For me too.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
But it's great!<br />
  <br />
JACK<br />
Thanks.<br />
 <br />
(JACK looks over at ANDY)<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Is this going to be okay?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Of course.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I just don't want anything to change.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
It won't. <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(Noticing that ANDY hasn't said anything, he decides to change the subject. To WILL) So what's the plan?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Umm - I don't know. (to SKIP) You didn't see anything?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Nope.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Did you check each of the closets?<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Each?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. There's one in each floor.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
How the hell was I supposed to know that!?<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
That's okay. (to SKIP) Let's go look in the other ones.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Fine. (to WILL) Each floor!? Is there anything else I should know? Is there some mystical passage way I don't know about?<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
All right! Let's go.<br />
 <br />
(SKIP and JACK exit. Long silence)<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to ANDY) Hello?<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Are you okay?<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm fine.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
You don't look fine.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(beat) I don't understand why you're okay with this.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I'm sorry?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
This doesn't bother you?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Why would it?<br />
<br />
 <br />
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
HOW CAN YOU IGNORE <br />
HE IS NOT THE SAME <br />
TO SAY THAT I LOVED HIM ALMOST SOUNDS PROFANE <br />
<br />
YOU SAY THAT YOU DON'T CARE <br />
BUT HOW CAN YOU NOT <br />
HE LIED TO ALL OF US <br />
THAT MATTERS A LOT <br />
JACK IS GONE <br />
NOW THERE'S ONLY FAIRY DUST <br />
<br />
HE WONT BELONG AS LONG AS IM A PART OF US<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
SO GO<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
CAUSE JACK MEANS MORE THAN ME?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
NO <br />
CAUSE I JUST DON'T AGREE <br />
THAT JACK HAS TO LEAVE NOW THAT HE'S OPENED UP <br />
HE'S OUR BEST FRIEND, DON'T WE ASK THAT OF HIM? <br />
WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY THAT HE'S NOT ALLOWED  <br />
TO OPEN UP "THAT WAY" <br />
<br />
OKAY?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
NO <br />
I CAN'T PRETEND NOT TO CARE <br />
I LOOK AND MY FRIEND ISNT THERE <br />
I DON'T LIKE BEING LIED TO <br />
<br />
HOW CAN YOU? <br />
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG <br />
YOU ALWAYS SEE THE UPSIDE <br />
WHY?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
CAUSE I CAN STILL SEE HIM WHEN I LOOK AT HIS FACE <br />
<br />
HE'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT, HE'S JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE <br />
WHY CANT YOU SEE THAT? <br />
PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE <br />
WHY GREET THAT CHANGE BY CAUSING HIM PAIN?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
IM NOT TRYING TO HURT HIM<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
BUT CAN'T YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
LOOK, THIS ISNT MY BURDEN<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
IF YOU'RE HIS FRIEND, THEN YOU'D BETTER START<br />
<br />
<br />
         <br />
<br />

      <br />

 JACK NEVER SAID THAT YOU HAD TO LIVE <br />
 YOUR LIFE ONE WAY <br />
LET GO OF YOUR BIAS, HE IS YOUR FRIEND  <br />
OR THIS COULD BE<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
 THINGS ARE DIFFERENT, WILL <br />
THINGS HAVE CHANGED <br />
JACK IS NO LONGER WITH US <br />
ONLY THE BODY REMAINS <br />
NOW ITS JUST YOU AND ME  <br />
AND SKIP. ONE TWO THREE<br />
<br />
WILL AND ANDY<br />
NOT FOUR ANYMORE<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
So you're willing to throw away everything. Just like that!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I guess so.<br />
 <br />
(JACK and SKIP enter unseen by WILL and ANDY.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why is this such a problem for you?<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Because he lied! Because he's been lying to us for the past 8 years!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Jesus... this is so twisted! He didn't lie to us!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Fine, think whatever you want. I'm leaving!<br />
<br />
 <br />
(ANDY grabs his jacket off the player's bench)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy. I think if you just talk to him -<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
No Will! I don't need to do anything. This is his issue. Not mine.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No! You're the one who's making this an issue.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
This isn't about me!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
This is about you. This is all about you. You're the one who's being a fucking asshole!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
No! You know what fuck you! Go ahead and have fun with your little faggot friend.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY starts to exit and sees JACK and SKIP standing by the bleachers. SKIP steps forward to say something to ANDY but JACK stops him)<br />
 <br />
OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
JACK (to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS <br />
<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS <br />
LIKE WHAT I OVERHEARD <br />
YOU JUST SAY ABOUT ME<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU? <br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS <br />
WE DON'T ALL WALK AROUND <br />
<br />
SAYING WHATEVER WE WANT<br />
 <br />
CAUSE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE <br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL <br />
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE <br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
 <br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW <br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS <br />
DONT FUCK WITH EACH OTHER <br />
UNLESS THEY WANT TO LOSE EACH OTHER <br />
AND YOU JUST LOST ME<br />
 <br />
(JACK waits for ANDY to say something. ANDY remains silent.)<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
And now you have nothing to say.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
You came here tonight and dropped this shit on us...and assumed that everything would be fine.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Why are you being such a dick?<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Mind your own fucking business!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Okay, enough.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Where do you get off talking to him like that?<br />
<br />
  <br />
ANDY<br />
I don't have to listen to this. I'm leaving!<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to exit)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Good!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Yeah, have a great time without me. You fuckin' prick!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(grabs ANDY by the arm) Just wait a minute! You need to talk about this.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
There's nothing to talk about. I'm going home!<br />
 <br />
<br />
(WILL grabs ANDY's arm)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(with a huge outburst) NO YOU'RE NOT! (Silence) We've been friends for 8 years. I'm not letting you throw that away just because we haven't seen each other for a few months. We can fix this. Just forget about it.<br />
 <br />
FORGET ABOUT IT<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG <br />
REMEMBER THOSE DREAMS THAT YOU LET GO OF <br />
CAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD YOU  <br />
THAT YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DREAM THE WAY YOU DO <br />
DIDN'T YOU<br />
<br />
 <br />
AND NOW EVERYTHING IS ASS BACKWARDS <br />
AND WE SEE EACH OTHER THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES <br />
EVERYTHING IS ASS BACKWARDS <br />
AND WE'RE BECOMING PEOPLE WE DESPISE <br />
SO WHY NOT TRY AND FORGET ABOUT IT?<br />
 <br />
<br />
FORGET ABOUT IT <br />
WHEN YOU SEE ALL THE INCONSISTENSIES IN THE WAY WE SEE THE WORLD <br />
FORGET ABOUT IT <br />
WHEN YOU LEARN THAT SOMEONE YEARNS TO BE DIFFERENT<br />
 <br />
THINGS CAN CHANGE <br />
BUT THINGS CANNOT GO AWRY <br />
<br />
SO FORGET ABOUT IT <br />
AND MOVE ON <br />
ALL RIGHT?<br />

YES IT IS <br />
PEOPLE CHANGE <br />

AND PEOPLE LIE <br />
PEOPLE TRY TO SAVE A FRIENDSHIP <br />
IS IT SO HARD  <br />

SKIP<br />
Nothing.<br />

JACK<br />
Then why is he acting like this!?  I'm not trying to fuck things up!<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
I know.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
He's such an asshole.<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Are you really surprised?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
What do you mean?<br />
 <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US <br />
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT <br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE AT THE DROP OF A HAT <br />
SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISING	 <br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR <br />
<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT WON'T LET US NEAR<br />
 <br />
ANDY  <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY <br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM <br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
<br />
ANDY <br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY <br />
IS HOW MUCH HE'S HOLDING BACK <br />
LIKE IT'LL HURT TO LET GO <br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
MAYBE <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY <br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF <br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO <br />
MAYBE <br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY <br />
<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US <br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE <br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY <br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE? <br />
<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO <br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY <br />
THE BEST FRIEND THAT I ONCE KNEW <br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP AND JACK<br />
ITS EMBARASSING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD <br />
AND STILL NOT SEE A THING <br />
ABOUT<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY <br />
IS WE MAY HAVE LET HIM DOWN <br />
AND THAT CANT BE UNDONE<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY <br />
HAS PUSHED HIM AWAY FROM US <br />
BEFORE WE HAD BEGUN<br />
 <br />
SKIP AND JACK<br />
TO FINALLY LEARN ONE <br />
<br />
THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
 SKIP<br />
I don't think any of us know each other as well as we think we do.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I think I know you pretty well.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Sure, but you don't know everything.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Okay fine, but I feel like I know something about you. I don't feel like I know anything about Andy. It's like he's a completely different person. Like something got added on or taken away. That's not the same kid I grew up with.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
And that's exactly the way he feels about you. You're not the same person either. You've changed. We all change.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Thanks Socrates. Some of us change for the better. I think Andy's regressed.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Look, this is gonna work itself out. I don't think he meant to say the things he did. Just give him some time to cool off, then you two can talk. He'll come around.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I hope so.<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So is there a guy?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Excuse me?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Like a guy? Like a boyfriend guy?<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Is that what you call it?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
(laughs) Sure, you can call it that.<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Who is he?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
His name's Michael.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Michael! Did you meet him at school?<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
No. I actually took some time off at the end of the semester, and met him while I was in Iowa.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Iowa?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. I took a road trip for a month.<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Really!?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yea.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Where did you go?<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
As far as I could get on the money I had, which wasn't much. I hit like 11 states I think.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Including Iowa. Wow. Why did you decide to do that?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. I wanted a change. There was...stuff I needed to figure out.<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So you dropped everything and just... left?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yea.<br />
 <br />
(WILL enters behind the bleachers. He is unseen by JACK and SKIP)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I can't believe you did that. I wish I had taken that kind of time to put things in perspective for myself. I feel like I'm stuck, like I want to jump start something but I don't know how to make that happen.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Neither does Andy. .<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Or Will. Especially Will! He hasn't changed at all. In fact he's in a perpetual battle against change. It's like he wants us to be the same friends we were in high school, and we're not. I mean what in the world made him think that this prank was a good idea?"<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
It's like, grow up already.<br />
<br />
AFTER ALL<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN I FEEL ALONE, I HAVE THESE FRIENDS OF MINE <br />
<br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME, WHO KEEP ME SANE IN TROUBLED TIMES <br />
AND WHEN I LOSE MY WAY, I HAVE THEM THERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND <br />
AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY AFTER ALL<br />
 <br />
WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I ONLY HAD MYSELF <br />
TO GUIDE MY LIFELESS ACTION FIGURES TO THE FLOOR, DOWN FROM THE SHELF <br />
MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY <br />
<br />
THAT I WOULD FIND A REAL FRIEND TO GUIDE ME SOMEDAY <br />
AND NOW<br />
 <br />
WHEN I FEEL ALONE, I HAVE THESE FRIENDS OF MINE <br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME, WHO KEEP ME SANE IN TROUBLED TIMES <br />
AND WHEN I LOSE MY WAY, I HAVE THEM THERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND <br />
AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY AFTER ALL<br />
<br />
<br />
A YEARS GONE BY AND WHAT WE HAD HAS CHANGED <br />
NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE FOR WHAT WE'D PERFECTLY ARRANGED <br />
I SCOUR OVER MEMORIES; I FEEL UNTIL I'M NUMB <br />
BUT I STILL CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW WE GOT HERE FROM WHERE WE'RE FROM <br />
AND NOW  <br />
WHEN I FEEL ALONE <br />
<br />
WHEN I FEEL ALONE<br />
<br />
WE'VE TURNED OUR BACKS ON ALL THE THINGS WE SAID WE LOVED <br />
CAUSE EVERYONE'S DECIDED THAT THIS ISNT WHAT IT WAS <br />
WELL NOBODY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT WE'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE <br />
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IM THE ONLY ONE WHO'S STILL THE SAME <br />
AND NOW<br />
<br />
 <br />
I AM STILL ALONE WITH ALL THESE FRIENDS OF MINE <br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME WHO RAN AWAY IN TROUBLES <br />
AND NOW I FEEL THE SHAME OF HOLDING ONTO WHAT'S NO LONGER MINE <br />
MAYBE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AFTER ALL <br />
AND I JUST NEVER SAW IT AT ALL<br />
 <br />

(SKIP notices a bottle of Blankson Brew sitting on the bleachers.)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Who brought this?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Andy. He stole it from his Dad's fridge.<br />

(SKIP picks up the bottle and takes a swig.)<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
(sarcastic) Mmm... (reads the label) Blankson's Brew. This is quality. (offers Jack a sip) You want?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
No thanks. You know I didn't have a single drop of alcohol this past year, and wonder of wonders I'm still sane.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah but you're gay. See what sobriety can do to you?<br />

JACK<br />
Dick.<br />

No, that's for you. (SKIP takes a swig.) This shit sucks!<br />

What is it?<br />

WILL<br />
It's none of your business!<br />

Come on!<br />

WILL<br />
Could you not?<br />

JACK<br />
"She taught 6th grade and had a pet rat named Bean, who smelled like a combination of kitty litter and old urine."<br />

Hey, I remember Bean!<br />

"There was no reason why these four boys should have been friends. What tied them together was the fact that they were uncommon. They were the outcasts of their 6th grade class. Jackson Ritchie was incredibly small for his age and was constantly teased about it. Within the first week, he had been shoved into 4 lockers by the same group of 8th graders. Hopper Thomas was a military brat who had lived in 5 different states before the age of 12. The fact that he was the new kid and had a goofy first name didn't help."<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yeah, your parents weren't really thinking long term with that one, were they?<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I was named after my grandfather.<br />

Why didn't they just name you Norman?<br />

SKIP<br />
I don't know. Shut up!<br />

Hey! Don't yell at me. You should be thanking us for giving you such a kick ass nickname.<br />

Anything's better then Hopper.<br />

"Anderson Scott, on the other hand, seemed like a fairly normal kid. But, Andy had a slight problem. From a very young age Andy had a bladder problem. In short, Andy couldn't control his pee and he became the first 6th grader in the history of Walden Middle School to piss his pants."<br />

Take that out!<br />

No Will, keep it in. That's the best part!<br />

"And Williamson Henry had trouble with his weight. He was both the shortest and heaviest kid in his class, and no one let him forget it. Until he met Skip, Jack and Andy." <br />

JACK<br />
Awww.... fatty.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
"What at first seemed like a last resort actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. No matter what happened, they always never had to be alone. Their friendship is the type that defines a person; the kind of connection that lasts a lifetime. Life seems to push you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned them around so that they could find each other."<br />

You know why they called you that though, right?<br />

Dude that was not baby fat. That was fat fat. You came to school with like twenty Snack Packs a day. You looked like Chunk from The Goonies!<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
How many kids do you think have graduated from Sturmsville?<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So many.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
That's not a number, Jack. (laughs) Think about it though. The number of kids who sat, just like we did, dreaming about their futures.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
How many kids do you think have sat on these bleachers? (Will runs over to the bleachers and stands on the first row of seats) How many? Who sat here? (Will runs back to the third row and stands) Who sat here?<br />
<br />
(The guys laugh)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No seriously! (beat) How many people have made out right where you're sitting? (Points to where Andy is sitting)<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda"<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who that was. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...even then there are probably a thousand Chris' and Amanda's.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I wonder if Amanda is hot?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
I wonder if she even knows her name is out here.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Do you think they can feel us thinking about her right now?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Can you feel it when somebody is thinking about you?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I can feel someone looking when I'm picking my nose in the car...<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
True! So true!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(Will is examining the field) Think about all this grass. How many blades of grass are out here, do you think? Staring at us, breathing the air we exhale, living because of us. Right now, our CO2 is becoming their oxygen. We live because of them too. We owe everything to this grass.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
You're insane.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No, I just have a very vivid imagination.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(getting up) So are we gonna set these sprinklers off or not?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
We still don't know the password.<br />

WILL<br />
Did you guys check every closet?<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
You didn't give us the keys.<br />

WILL<br />
Oh (he pulls the keys out of his jacket pocket) Sorry. (he hands the keys to SKIP)<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'll go find it.<br />

(SKIP starts to exit)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to ANDY and JACK) You guys wanna come with? (to JACK) Or...<br />
<br />

(SKIP looks at JACK and nods)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No, it's okay.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Andy?<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) It's cool.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
We got it. Let's go!<br />
 <br />
(SKIP and WILL exit. ANDY and JACK are left alone. There is a long silence. ANDY takes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. JACK stares at him. ANDY offers one to JACK)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No... thanks.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY lights a cigarette.)<br />
<br />
When did you start that?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
A couple months ago.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Why?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
It's relaxing.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
That's dumb.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Thanks.<br />
 <br />
(JACK just stares at ANDY. ANDY feels the stare, and puts out the cigarette. He takes a big, deep swig of his beer, almost finishing it. JACK picks up the copy of Playboy that has been lying on the ground. He begins flipping through pages. He opens it up to the centerfold and examines it.)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Wow. She's hot.<br />
 <br />
(ANDY stares at him. Silence.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't you think?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
She's all right.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
She's better then all right, I think. (He examines the picture further) Except for this.<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Look at that bush. It's like an untouched forest down there! I can't deal with that. You gotta do a little upkeep. You know, trim away some of the hedge...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Come on.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I know you don't want to talk about that.<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK closes the magazine and tosses it back on the ground. Another long, awkward silence. ANDY opens his duffle bag and pulls out two bottles of beer.)<br />
<br />
You want one of these?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sighs) Sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
(ANDY hands a bottle to JACK. They both take a couple of sips. JACK winces at the taste.)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Remember when we used to steal liquor from Will's Dad's cabinet?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(ANDY cracks a smile) Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'll never forget that time we got caught. Mr. Henry's face will forever be etched in my mind. I'll never forget it, I thought Will was gonna get strangled.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I got in so much trouble for that too. I was grounded for like a month.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You were always grounded! You must have spent half of middle school in your room.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
I know! And I did the same shit you guys did. Like when we stole that sign from the Presbyterian Church on Marengo.<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
(laughing) "God Answers Knee Mail."<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah! My mom took my car away. Wouldn't let me go out for three weeks. You guys weren't even punished!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I had to spend winter break doing inventory at my dad's store.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Whoop-de-fucking-do! I had to baby sit Samantha every day!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
She's so cute though.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
She's Satan.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
She's your sister!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
She's a bitch!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
She's six!<br />
 <br />
(ANDY shrugs and takes another sip of beer)<br />
<br />
So... who's Beth?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm sorry?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Beth?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Oh, just a girl I've been...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Ah hah. How long?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
A few weeks.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
How'd you meet?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
At the pool.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
And she lives around here?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah. She went to Roosevelt.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Oh. So you spotted her across the deep end and it was love at first sight?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Not quite.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
What's she like?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
She's nice.<br />
 <br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Wow, you must really think a lot of her.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
What do you want? She's cool, smart. Wants to teach elementary school. Like first graders. (long pause) And she's hot.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
THAT's what I was waiting for!<br />
 <br />
(JACK and ANDY laugh. SKIP and WILL enter. SKIP is waving a sheet of paper in the air)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Look what we found!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
You got it!<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
This is definitely it.<br />

(They all rush over to the box.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Hold on! Shouldn't we say something?<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Like what?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I don't know. This is a pretty big moment. I don't want to jump right into it. (looks at SKIP) Skip?<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Don't look at me. I don't know what to say.<br />
 <br />
(JACK, SKIP, ANDY, and WILL - all look in the box and try to think of something to say.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I got it! It's been fun - let's get this shit done! (Proud of his rhyming abilities, he sticks his hand in the box.)<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
(Smacking Andy's hand out of the way) No - that sucked!<br />
<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Then you say it!<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Fine - I will! (silence) So, here we are... our 2nd annual prank. (silence)<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Wow! No you're right, yours was much better.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I'm not done! So we're back together after one long lonely year apart and tonight we're going to make some history!<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Damn straight!<br />
 <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to SKIP) The paper, my good man.<br />
 <br />
(SKIP hands the paper to WILL. WILL unlocks the box)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
We should have like a signature that we leave behind when we're done.<br />
 <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What do you mean?<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
Like a sign. You know like when Zorro does that Z thing.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
We could call ourselves "Los Banditos."<br />
 <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That'd be sick!<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
And we could each have our own code name. (to ANDY) Like we could call you "Tonto."<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Yeah!<br />
<br />
(JACK laughs)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? (SKIP laughs) What!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Tonto means dumb in Spanish.<br />

ANDY<br />
Fuck that!<br />

JACK<br />

WILL<br />
Is he cool? What is he like?<br />

JACK<br />
Yea he's great, why would I date him if he wasn't?<br />

WILL<br />
What does he look like? I'm picturing a big black guy for some reason...<br />

JACK<br />
(laughs) No, he's white.<br />

You guys don't want to hear this.<br />

No, actually it's not.<br />

Nothing. Just forget it.<br />

ANDY<br />
Listen, I think I've been doing a pretty good job of staying quiet...<br />

SKIP<br />
Staying quiet? What, do you want some kind of award for that?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Skip, enough.<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
No! He's said some shitty things to you tonight and I wanna know why. (to ANDY) Is it going to be like this every time we hang out? Do we have to treat it like it's some big secret! He's GAY, Andy, get used to it.<br />
 <br />
ANDY<br />
That's not the point! I just -<br />

THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />

THE THING ABOUT ANDY  <br />
IS HE IS ALLOWED TO  <br />

FEEL HOW HE WANTS TO<br />
<br />
YOU MAY NOT AGREE, BUT IM THE ONE WHO'S HURT, SO IT'S NOT YOUR CHOICE <br />
YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT WHO YOU SAID YOU WERE, SO YOU LOST YOUR VOICE <br />
BUT YOU STILL TELL ME THIS IS ALL MY FAULT <br />
CAUSE YOU GUYS LIKE PRETENDING YOU'RE ADULTS<br />

ALL OF YOU <br />

JACK<br />
Andy, don't go. We need to talk about this!<br />

ANDY<br />
No. Just leave me alone.<br />

Should I go after him?<br />

 <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
No, fuck that! That doesn't make it right.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
You said give him time to cool off. And you jumped all over him.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So? I'm not gonna let him talk to you like that!<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Skip, I can take care of myself. I don't need you fighting my battles.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
So it's my fault for yelling at him?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
I didn't say that.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />

Then what!? If he can't accept that this is the way things are then fuck him. Let him go! Maybe it's better.<br />

SKIP<br />
Without him. I'm saying, maybe it's better that he left.<br />

(The sound and lights of a car pulling out of the parking lot.)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Well this is great. Some fucking friends we are.<br />
 <br />
(Another long silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'm gonna go. Do you guys want a ride?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
We're not gonna finish?<br />
<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
You want to?<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Not really.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
You never did.<br />
<br />
 <br />
(SKIP and JACK begin to exit.)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You coming?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
That's okay.<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Come on.<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
No...I think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Okay. (looks around) Goodnight, man.<br />
<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Night, guys.<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Hey, I'll give you a call tomorrow. Maybe the three of us can see a movie or something?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
Maybe.<br />
<br />
 <br />
JACK<br />
Yea maybe. Well...I'll call you.<br />
 <br />
SKIP<br />
Night man.<br />
 <br />
(SKIP and JACK exit. WILL crumples up the paper with the password and sits down on the bleachers.)<br />
<br />
<br />
TURN AROUND<br />
 <br />
 WILL<br />
FOR SOME REASON "THREE" SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT EMPTY <br />
FOR SOME REASON "FOUR" HAD A NICER RING <br />
FOR SOME REASON WE COULDN'T HOLD ON TO EACH OTHER <br />
BECAUSE OF OUR DIFFERENCES IN THINGS<br />
<br />
<br />
FOR SOME REASON I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY OVER <br />
FOR SOME REASON THIS ENDING SEEMS TOO CLEAN <br />
FOR SOME REASON, WE EVER MET IN THE FIRST PLACE <br />
AND I THINK THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN<br />
<br />
WE USED TO SNEAK OUT LATE <br />
TO STAND WHERE I AM NOW <br />
<br />
LIKE WE'D NEVER GO AWAY<br />
<br />
LITTLE DID I KNOW <br />
I'D BE BACK OUT HERE NOW <br />
IN SUCH A DIFFERENT PLACE <br />
JUST AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY<br />
<br />
TURN AROUND <br />
<br />
FACE THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT <br />
BUT TURN AROUND <br />
TURN AROUND AND YOU JUST MIGHT BE FOUND<br />
<br />
TURN AROUND  <br />
TURN AWAY AND TRY TO SAY THAT IT'S OKAY <br />
TO TURN AROUND <br />
<br />
TURN AROUND AND YOU JUST MIGHT BE FOUND<br />
<br />
(WILL opens up his notebook and reads.)<br />
<br />
"Will had been grounded for the last two weeks of his summer vacation. As he sat alone in his room, an unexpected knock came from the second story window. He turned around to see Andy's smiling face hovering outside. Will looked down to see Skip and Jack struggling to support Andy's legs. Andy tried to say something but quickly lost his grip and plummeted to the ground. They all landed in a heap, laughing and hopelessly trying to untangle themselves. Will smiled. He was only 13, but he knew the idiots on his front lawn were the brothers he never had."<br />
<br />
THIS WILL ALWAYS BE HOME <br />
WHERE WE DREAMED UNDER THESE SAME STARS <br />
WE CAN ALWAYS COME HOME <br />
<br />
TO RECLAIM WHAT ONCE WAS OURS <br />
THIS IS OUR HOME <br />
WITH MEMORIES FROM A LIFETIME AGO <br />
THAT ONLY SEEM TO SHOW<br />
<br />
THAT I SHOULD TURN AROUND <br />
AND TURN AWAY FROM WHAT HAD BROUGHT ME HERE TODAY <br />
<br />
TURN AROUND  <br />
AND MAYBE THEN I'LL BE FOUND AGAIN<br />
<br />
(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL. WILL just sits on the bench. He closes the notebook. Blackout.)<br />

GLORY DAYS<br />
A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />
<br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench.)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
<br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
<br />
Page 1<br />
        <br />
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL pulls his notebook out of his backpack)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO <br />
<br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

(SKIP THOMAS, 19, enters without WILL noticing.)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Who're you talking to...? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(startled) Skip!! Heyyy!!<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL slams his notebook shut and tosses it under the bench) <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(imitating) Heyyy buddy!!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's so good to see you.<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL hugs SKIP)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You too. (beat) Where are the other fools? I thought you said midnight.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(exasperated) I know... I probably should have told them 9. (beat) What's up with your hair?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You like? I'm just letting nature do its thing.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(amused) You look like a girl.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Oh, you wanna start already? Cause we can go, Tub Tubs!<br />
<br />
(SKIP playfully slaps WILL in the stomach)<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <br />
        <br />
            <br />
                <br />

            	<br />
        <br />
    <br />
<br />
    SKIP <br />
 Wanna go? Let's go! Who's a girl now? Huh? Who's a girl now Tub Tubs? Wanna cry?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'm joking! No. Okay, okay! No, no, no. I'm sorry. Cut it out.<br />
<br />
    <br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
HEY, look, if you don't stop I'm not gonna tell you what we're doing tonight!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(stops) What we're doing? I thought this was it.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope. I've got a plan. Tell me -<br />
<br />
Page 3<br />
        <br />
ARE YOU READY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ARE YOU READY TO MAKE HISTORY?<br />
RIGHT HERE ON THIS FOOTBALL FIELD<br />
YOU AND ME<br />
AND TWO OTHER GUYS<br />
WHO COULD SHOW UP AT ANY TIME<br />
<br />
WHEN EVER THEY DO GET HERE, I'M<br />
HOPING YOU'RE READY <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What are we doing?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I can't tell you that.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(coyly) Cause... I don't know if I trust you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Just tell me!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Not yet!<br />
WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT<br />
WE ALL WILL BE HERE FINALLY<br />
AND WHEN WE ARE, YOU'LL FINALLY SEE<br />
"WHAT THIS HIGH SCHOOL MEANS TO ME"<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
HOW 'BOUT A HINT?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
 HOW 'BOUT WE WAIT FOR ALL THE GUYS<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'LL ACT LIKE I'M STILL SURPRISED!<br />
<br />
Page 4<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
FINE. DO YOU LIKE WATER RIDES?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Are we going to Sea World?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Really?!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Nope. But close.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 I hate you. (beat) Is it something -? <br />
WILL <br />
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS<br />
<br />
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO<br />
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO<br />
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU<br />
<br />
(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.) <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?<br />
  <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Superman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) Fuck that!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Jaaaack!<br />
<br />
Page 5<br />
        <br />
JACK<br />
Wiiill! What's up Holmes!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What's up Skillet!?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(sees SKIP) Hey, who's the hippie?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, nice to see you too.<br />
<br />
(Without missing a beat, ANDY tries to get SKIP's opinion on the whole Batman vs. Superman debate.)  <br />
<br />
WILL <br />
<br />
(to JACK)ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST YEAR!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(looking around)I GOTTA SAY IT'S PRETTY WEIRD <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HOW WAS LIFE AT SCHOOL?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
PROBABLY THE SAME AS YOU<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S TRUE UNLESS YOU ROOMED WITH ANDY TOO.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to ANDY) Drop it -<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU THINK THAT BATMAN<br />
WOULD LOSE A BATTLE TO A GUY IN TIGHTS? <br />
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THOSE GAY RED UNDIES <br />
HE WEARS OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS? <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN <br />
TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN<br />
    <br />
Page 6<br />
        <br />
BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT <br />
<br />
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What's your point?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sooo... ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?<br />
<br />

<br />
YOU AND YOU AND YOU AND ME<br />
<br />
ALL<br />

<br />
WILL<br />

<br />
JACK<br />
I'VE MISSED YOU GUYS <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY(to JACK)<br />
YOU ONLY LIKE SUPERMAN CAUSE HE FLIES<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 NOW ARE YOU READY FOR<br />
<br />
ALL GUYS<br />
READY <br />
<br />

<br />
WILL<br />
What took you guys so long?<br />
<br />
Page 7<br />
        <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I said I was sorry!  I'm sorry!<br />
    <br />
(WILL runs over to his backpack)<br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
Slobbers? What was he doing?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I was not! <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Slobbering all over the sofa. <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Whatever man! My sister was watching it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh yeaaah, how's she doing? <br />
<br />
(JACK laughs)<br />
ANDY<br />
(to SKIP)  Don't start man -<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What!? I'm genuinely interested!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(suspicious) She's fine.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me? <br />
<br />
<br />
    <br />
    ANDY<br />
        I'm gonna punch you in the face -<br />
    <br />
    SKIP<br />
        Hey now, there's no need to get all huffy... it's not my fault your sister's bangin'!<br />
    <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
She's twelve years old!<br />
    <br />
JACK<br />
Hey, whatever floats your boat, right?<br />
<br />
Page 8<br />
        <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(to JACK) My sister is not allowed to float anyone's boat!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Aww, you're no fun.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
But your sister is!<br />
<br />
SKIP and JACK<br />
OHHHHHHH!!(raspberry<br />
<br />
(SKIP and JACK slap high five)<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
(grabbing at SKIP and JACK)<br />
<br />
Come here!<br />
    <br />
(ANDY chases SKIP and JACK around the field)<br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
What? Take it as a compliment. You've got good genes!<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
I swear to God-<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY! (WILL throws his arms around ANDY to hold him back. Andy continues to struggle)<br />
    <br />
(to ANDY)Chill! Look, we've got important business to take care of - <br />
<br />
    (ANDY stops struggling and WILL releases him.<br />
    <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I got you later! <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh yeah?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, I do!<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(scolding) Okay, enough! Here. Read.<br />
<br />
(WILL hands ANDY a newspaper clipping)<br />
<br />
Page 9<br />
        <br />
ANDY<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
<br />
    JACK<br />
        A piece of paper.<br />
    <br />
    ANDY<br />
        I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?<br />
<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
Just read!<br />
<br />
(ANDY takes a look at the paper. Clears his throat and reads)<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
(reading)"Come one, come all to the Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." The FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Keep reading!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside) mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend."<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Wow, you read that really well!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Shut up! (to WILL) What the hell is this?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This,my friend, is inspiration.<br />
<br />
(WILL takes the paper from ANDY and walks back towards the player's bench) <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? <br />
<br />
Page 10<br />
<br />
        <br />
SKIP<br />
Oh Good. We need some of that....<br />
<br />
(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please. <br />
<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
Ah, hell yeah!(ANDY begins drum roll)<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
Matt Hoffman, Chris Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - <br />
    <br />
JACK<br />
<br />
No shit!? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Is it Jesus?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. Better. You see that box?<br />
<br />
(WILL points to a small weather box situated near the players bench)<br />
ANDY<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Skip?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Uh-huh. Box. Got it.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
That box contains something truly magical. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL tosses the key to ANDY)<br />
<br />
Page 11<br />
        <br />
ANDY<br />
(gets it) Fucking genius!<br />
<br />
JACK <br />
<br />
I don't get it.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(amazed. To WILL) We're gonna soak the bastards!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 Why?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
 Cause it's funny as shit!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we got walked on or treated like we didn't matter. This is karma at its finest boys! <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Blown! My mind is officially blown. <br />
<br />
(SKIP takes the key from ANDY) <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
We've waited for this moment for five years and tomorrow it's on. All we have to do is reset the timer.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(extends his hand to WILL) Well done sir!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(shakes ANDY's hand) Ah thank you sir!<br />
<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
I take back every time I called you queer. (beat) For the next five minutes.<br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
How did you get this?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I have my sources.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know people. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No you don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
Page 12<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
Look, it doesn't matter how I got it! The fact is I got it! So come on let's do this! (motions the guys towards the box)   <br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
Why're you being so weird about it?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'm not. It's just not important.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Are you gonna tell us or not?<br />

ANDY<br />
FAT PAT!?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to SKIP, referencing ANDY) Exactly why I didn't want to tell you!<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You don't remember PAT!? Sophomore? Redhead? She's the janitor's niece. Kinda ... thick?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy - <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What!?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Don't call her thick!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm creating a visual. <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You did just call her Fat Pat.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(to WILL) Wait, is this the girl who asked you to homecoming, but you said no for religious reasons? <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That's the one!<br />
<br />

        <br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Why'd she give it to you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(a slight hesitation) Cause she was being nice.<br />
   <br />
ANDY<br />
(joking) Yeah right! What'd you do, take her out on a date?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) No, it wasn't a - (stops mid sentence. Catches himself)<br />

 Oh sweet Lord Jesus NO! (beat) You DID!<br />

WILL<br />
No I - No. (pause) It wasn't a date.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(hardly controlling himself) Then what was it?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
We just went out to eat.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
To EAT!? That's an operation. Where'd you take her, Cracker Barrel? No wait! No no wait I got it - it's coming to me - where would you take her so no one would see you AND your Jew ass could feed her for cheap... Denny's!<br />
<br />
    (WILL remains silent)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yes!!! I knew it! What'd she get? I have to know.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, it doesn't matter! She got us the key.<br />
<br />
Page 14<br />
        <br />
    ANDY<br />
        I don't care. I wanna know what she got for dinner! A steak, or three? Some cheeseburgers? Maybe a little Chocolate Brownie Fudge Delight with some extra fixins?<br />

ANDY<br />
Ah come on man. We're just playing! Look, I think I speak for all of us when I say we're really proud of you!<br />

JACK<br />
Definitely.<br />
<br />
    <br />
    ANDY<br />
        She's a catch.<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
She's not a catch and you know it!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cause she's...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
...Fat? That's fucked up Will.<br />
<br />
(SKIP and JACK laughs at this)<br />
    <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
 I didn't say that. You're the one calling her fat!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
All I'm saying is she's a sure thing. (putting his arm around WILL) And Will, buddy, you need to start taking advantage of these opportunities. Cause let's be honest, you didn't really get any this year.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(pushing ANDY away) Just cuz I didn't want any of the diseased skanks that you and your frat brothers hooked up with doesn't mean I didn't get any.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What are you talking about? Those girls were prime real estate!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Woah, woah, woah. I'm sorry. You joined a frat? <br />

ANDY<br />

SKIP<br />
And it's just lame.<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
You're lame!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Isn't that kinda like buying your friends? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(offended) No! It's about a brotherhood.  A fellowship! A bond! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
That you pay for.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Whatever man, all I know is I was getting some high quality poon this year while you were sitting alone in the room jerkin the gherkin! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I was not.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh really? Why don't you tell Jack and Skip how many girls you boofed?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
They don't care. Look, we're getting really off track -<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'm kind of interested.<br />
<br />
  ANDY<br />
  Well I'll tell you! The answer is zero. None! Nada! He couldn't get a single girl to touch his ittle Jewish ding-a-ling all year.<br />
<br />

WILL<br />
That's not true. <br />
<br />

Uh, okay, then. How many?<br />

WILL<br />
You don't have to talk to 'em when you're doing it.<br />

ANDY<br />
That's funny - this is your Mom's favorite position too.<br />

ANDY<br />
Shut up dude!<br />

Maybe once a week.<br />

ANDY<br />
Whatever, I was a great roommate.<br />

JACK<br />
I wouldn't want to live with you. <br />

WILL<br />
Can you imagine if the four of us had lived together? I mean what if we had all actually gone to the same school?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That would've been tight! The four of us in a suite, trading bitches like Pokemon cards!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Sorry for ruining your dream.<br />

WILL<br />
<br />
I mean, just think of all the stuff we could've pulled on a college campus. <br />

SKIP<br />
You mean stupid pranks like this one?<br />

WILL<br />
What are you talking about? This is gonna be epic! We're gonna go down in history for this.<br />

With who? No one's even gonna know we did it!<br />

Um, we'll know.<br />

Excuse me?<br />

ANDY<br />
Yea, but who says abort?<br />

My dad's in the military, jackass!<br />

No, actually, it won't.<br />

ANDY<br />
Get outta the way! You don't know how to turn a friggin key.<br />

Here. See you gotta turn it to the left you dil-<br />

You gotta turn it - to the -<br />

You gotta - <br />

ANDY<br />
(to WILL) You got the wrong key! <br />

I got the wrong key!? This is what she gave me. <br />

ANDY<br />
God damn it FAT PAT! <br />

WILL<br />
Andy -<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You got scammed by a plus sized hooker!<br />

She probably just got em mixed up.<br />

Page 25<br />
        <br />
JACK<br />
Can you call her?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
What? No!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You call her!<br />

ANDY<br />
Why the hell would I call her? She's your girlfriend!<br />

<br />
WILL<br />
She is not, shut up!<br />

ANDY<br />
Look, stop being a pussy. (ANDY takes out his phone) If she got em mixed up then she can bring over the right one-<br />
<br />
(ANDY tosses his phone to WILL)<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, its gonna give her the wrong idea.<br />
<br />
(WILL tosses the phone back to ANDY)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Just tell her to put down the pork chops and get over here-<br />
<br />
(ANDY tosses the phone to WILL)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I'm not doing it!<br />
    <br />
(WILL tosses the phone back to ANDY)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Well I guess we can't do the prank then.<br />

ANDY<br />
What are we supposed to do now?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Why don't we try hanging out for a change? You ever think of that?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
We are.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally together in the same place. Isn't that enough? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Sorry.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Think about it. We don't have to associate ourselves with this place ever again, so why do you wanna come back and pull some stupid prank? We're past that.<br />

WILL<br />
It's not stupid! <br />

And it sends a message. (the boys are unconvinced) It does!<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What message is that?<br />
<br />
Page 26<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
That we deserve respect.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
From who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
From them!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh that makes a ton of sense. (beat) Will. You really think they're gonna start respecting us for setting off sprinklers during their little charity football game?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
It's not about that - it's.... (beat) Come on, don't you think they deserve it!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Will it was five years ago!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
So!? It still happened! And all because we didn't make their precious little team -<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Here we go.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
But Will, they're not gonna care. They never did, so why would they start now?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Then maybe, it's not about them! Maybe it's about us!<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />

(WILL takes out his phone and dials)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That's my boy. Take one for the team!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'm always taking one for the team. (into the phone) Hi, Patty? <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I'm sorry... Patty?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
HAHA! FATTY PATTY!<br />
<br />
(Throughout WILL's phone call ANDY does everything he can to distract him. Sexual sounds, etc.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(glares at SKIP) It's Will! Hi. I'm fine. Listen, I'm calling because there seems to have been a bit of a mix up. The key that you gave me doesn't work. Yeah, nope.  So I was just wondering if there was any possibility - (beat) Oh, really!? No, that would be amazing! Thank you. (beat) Uh... Friday?<br />
<br />
<br />
Page 30<br />
        <br />
ANDY<br />
(giving it to Friday and hard) Oh yeah, Friday!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Umm... I'm actually kinda busy then... (looking to the guys for help)<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
No you're not...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(looking to the guys for help) I just -I got in a car accident yesterday, so... I'm injured. Injured bad. <br />
<br />
(SKIP, ANDY and JACK start laughing)<br />
<br />
Yea I'll be okay, just broke a few bones. Sure. Yeah just give me a call back okay. Great! Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What was that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cover.<br />
<br />
JACK <br />
What'd she say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
She's babysitting right now, so she's going to look and see what she can find. She said she'd call me back.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
So we're just waiting?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I guess so.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Dammit.<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I feel like we should have brought a board game or something. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Like Jenga!?<br />
<br />
Page 31<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
Jenga's not a board game!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I was thinking more along the lines of like Monopoly.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I hate Monopoly.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You would.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is that supposed to mean?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You're just not a Monopoly kinda guy. <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yea, cuz I hate it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No, I think it's more that you don't get it.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh I get it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you've acquired. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Thank you for admitting it.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
My roommate started a board game club in our dorm room this year. Didn't even ask me.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What a dick! What games?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Just one. Clue.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Ohhh Lord. I can only imagine the people who wanted to join that club.<br />
<br />
    <br />
Page 32<br />
        <br />
JACK<br />
Actually there were only five kids who kept coming back, but Jesus Christ they were annoying. They called themselves "the Clue Crew."<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
That's freakin weird dude. Your roommate sounds worse then Will.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Bite me.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was fine. I only had to put up with him for a little while.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Did he get kicked out?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Cause this kid on our floor got kicked out for smoking weed in his room. (to WILL) Remember Stevey?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Smart kid too ... he tried to create this like ventilation system out his window so the RA couldn't smell it. But somebody saw the smoke outside and called the fire department. Now he goes to community college. Fuckin' sucks.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(to JACK) What happened to him?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Your roommate... The Clue Meister.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Then why did you only put up with him for a little while?<br />
<br />
Page 33<br />
<br />
        <br />
JACK<br />
I didn't see him as much.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Just cause.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Wow, you're being awfully descriptive.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Well... (pause) I don't know. Ok. Actually I left before the semester ended. So....<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) What? <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Woah, woah, woah. Hold the phone... what did you do? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I left.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Just...left?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Where did you go?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I took a road trip.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
GET OUT! <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
That's awesome! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why didn't you tell us?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. It wasn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Are you shitting me?! That's huge!<br />
<br />
Page 34<br />
        <br />
SKIP<br />
How long were you gone?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
A little over a month... I got back like three weeks ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Wow, that's awesome! I'm jealous.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Wait...you've been home for three weeks? Why didn't you call us? (referencing ANDY too) We've been here.  <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I know. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I thought you were still at school. Did you not want us to know you were back?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just needed some time alone.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Well, I don't care, I wanna know everything! Where'd you go? What'd you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Everything?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay...<br />
<br />
THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL<br />
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP<br />
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
You kissed your Mom Dude? Gross...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR<br />

BUT I DIDN'T CARE<br />
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY<br />
<br />
Page 35<br />
        <br />
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST<br />
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN<br />
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO<br />
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS<br />
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY<br />
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />
<br />
AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />
AND WE WENT DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
WE WERE DRIVING<br />
JUST ME<br />
A BEAUTIFUL BOY<br />
AND THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />

CAUSE I CAN STILL SEE HIM WHEN I LOOK AT HIS FACE<br />
HE'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT, HE'S JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE<br />
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY<br />

WHY GREET THAT CHANGE BY CAUSING HIM PAIN?<br />

LET GO OF YOUR BIAS, HE IS YOUR FRIEND <br />

I WISH THINGS COULD STAY <br />

THINGS ARE DIFFERENT, WILL<br />
THINGS HAVE CHANGED<br />
JACK IS NO LONGER WITH US<br />

Only the best for my boys! Natty Light!<br />

Nope! (proudly) Bought em.<br />

This looks nothing like you.<br />

Sure it does!<br />

Well it worked didn't it?<br />

JACK<br />
(grabbing a beer) You know, I didn't have a single drop of alcohol this past year, and guess what, I'm still sane.<br />

Yeah but you're gay. See what sobriety can do to you? <br />

Nope.<br />

Amen to that.<br />

WILL<br />
(to JACK, about SKIP) So what do you think of this new look?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I wasn't gonna say anything but, you kinda look like a pothead. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I think he looks like a woman. <br />
<br />
(WILL and JACK laugh at this)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You know what? I don't really care if it looks good or not. <br />

WILL<br />
You should.<br />

Why? Who am I trying to impress?<br />

ANDY<br />
Not us, apparently. <br />

JACK<br />
<br />
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised. I thought you were gonna come back looking like a total Ivy Leauge prep. You know, pink polo with the popped collar...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Never! My roommate was like that. He wore plaid shorts every day of the week. It'd be 15 degrees outside and he'd still be wearing plaid shorts and boat shoes. Dumbass.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sounds like your kind of guy.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Not to mention the fact that his dad bought him a Lexus when he graduated from high school. <br />

WILL<br />
Jesus.<br />

JACK<br />
I got a check from my grandma that bounced.<br />

Yeah. And he was all pissed off cause it wasn't a Beamer. <br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
Shut up!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
So what did you say?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
To him - about the car.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What was I supposed to say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I dunno, a guy like that - I figured you'd let him have it.<br />
<br />
Page 45<br />
        <br />
SKIP<br />
Why would I "let him have it?" Nothing I'm gonna say is going to change anything, so why waste the energy?<br />

JACK<br />
...When you can just grow your hair out.<br />

Exactly!<br />

WILL<br />
Are you kidding me?! <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
What?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I've just never heard of you backing down from an opportunity like that. You're the most opinionated guy I know.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
My opinion doesn't mean shit Will! It's just one opinion. So why not go with the flow? I mean I'm doing your prank, aren't I?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not my prank! It's OUR prank!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Right. I forgot. Sorry. My point is who cares.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What does that mean, who cares?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I mean no one really listens to anyone anyway, they're all too wrapped up in themselves. So why should I be any different?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Because you are. You always have been. It's why we're friends.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
I thought we were friends because we sucked at football.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. We're friends because we're not like everybody else. We're different.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, see, as much as you think we're different, we're really not. You're sitting here, talking about how things should change. And not doing shit. Just like everybody else.<br />

THEY'VE ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS ON ALL THE THINGS WE SAID WE LOVED<br />
CAUSE EVERYONE'S DECIDED THAT THIS ISNT WHAT IT WAS<br />
WELL NOBODY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT WE'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE<br />
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IM THE ONE WHO'S STILL THE SAME<br />

I AM STILL ALONE WITH ALL THESE FRIENDS OF MINE<br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME WHO RAN AWAY IN TROUBLED TIMES<br />

But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other." <br />

How many kids do you think have graduated from this place?<br />

JACK<br />
So many.<br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
That's not a number, Jack.<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
(WILL sits up) Seriously though, how many kids have filed in and out of this building over the years, like it was a goddamn assembly line. I mean, how many kids do you think have sat out on these bleachers? Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! (Points to where Andy is sitting)<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." <br />
<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who they are. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...and even then there are probably thousands of Chris' and Amanda's. <br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
I bet Amanda's hot. Just saying.<br />

WILL<br />
    Think about all the stuff that has happened out here. And we're part of it. Cuz we're really here.<br />

    <br />
    (Everyone laughs)<br />
    <br />
    WILL<br />

        Listen jerks! Everything was going great, I didn't want the fact that we were different ages to mess anything up.<br />

        You should be proud. You skipped Kindergarten! That means you're smarter than us.<br />

        Yeah, who skips Kindergarten? Of all grades. "Oh, young William? He plays with blocks better than the other kids. Bump him!"<br />

<br />
Page 61<br />
        <br />
ANDY<br />
What? <br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
(into the phone) Don't worry about it. No no it's okay. <br />
<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
What did she say?<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Thanks anyway. (beat)  Umm... yeah I'm actually busy Thursday night too so.... Uh-huh. Yeah that's a bad night too. Remember- broken bones. I got broken bones. Okay well gotta run, but I'll talk to you later. Okay. Great! Bye. (hangs up the phone) Jesus.<br />

JACK<br />
(to WILL) What's wrong?<br />

WILL<br />
That girl does not give up.<br />

ANDY<br />

No, what's up with the key!?<br />

WILL<br />
Well... she says it's in the building.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
What!?<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Apparently it may be in the maintenance closet.<br />
    <br />
JACK<br />
So what did she give us?<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
She doesn't know, but now she's pretty sure it's in there.<br />
    <br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(sarcastic) Well that's great, we probably have his car keys. What are we supposed to do now?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />

How?<br />
<br />
Page 62<br />
        <br />
SKIP<br />
Well... there's that window in the gym. The one we used to sneak out of during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />

No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence) <br />
<br />
So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No. There isn't. <br />

WILL<br />
<br />
What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Kissed?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
<br />
Page 64<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? I mean, was it something that you always knew or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
I dunno, I just - I wanna know what it's like. What you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Well... I think part of me has alwyas known on some level. I was afraid to accept it. It wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, beat)<br />
<br />
Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
<br />
Page 65<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
<br />
Page 66<br />
        <br />
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
<br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />

Page 67<br />
        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away.  Silence.)<br />

WILL<br />

What was that for?<br />

(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />

ANDY<br />
(to Jack) You came here tonight and dropped this shit on us and thought that everything would be fine. It's NOT fine. You lied to us -<br />

JACK<br />
What?<br />

SKIP<br />
Jesus, he didn't lie to you! <br />

WILL<br />
Jack - <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What?<br />

JACK<br />
That you couldn't deal with it. That you've been sitting here all night not saying anything. Why not, why don't you just talk to me?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) Why would you tell him that....<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was being a good friend, Andy. I think I have the right to know that.<br />

ANDY<br />
(to WILL) I don't believe you. <br />

SKIP<br />
Why is this bothering you so much?<br />

I didn't tell you earlier, because I wasn't ready yet, Andy-<br />

Look, do whatever you want. I'm going.<br />

Why? What the fuck is your deal right now?<br />

THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(overlapping)<br />
...LOOK WHO'S "SPEAKING OUT"<br />
LIKE HE KNOWS ABOUT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />

JUST PUT THE BLAME ON ME<br />

JACK<br />
YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
 WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE I GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DONT FUCK WITH OTHER<br />
UNLESS THEY WANT TO LOSE EACH OTHER<br />
WELL, YOU JUST LOST ME<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
YOU DON'T CARE HOW I FEEL<br />
SO WHY SHOULD I CARE WHAT I SAY TO YOU?<br />
<br />
NO, I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DON'T FUCK WITH EACH OTHER<br />

He's supposed to be one of your best friends and you treat him like he wronged you. He did nothing to you. <br />

ANDY<br />

Skip -<br />

SKIP<br />
You just fucked up a friendship for all of us because you're too selfish to get that it's not always about YOU!<br />

Can I please say something?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
No! Everything that's coming out of your mouth tonight is toxic, and I'm tired of listening to it. <br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
I would never call him -<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, stop -<br />

YOU CAN'T KEEP LYING TO YOURSELF<br />
AND HOPE YOU'LL FORGET IT<br />
LYING TO KEEP US CLOSE<br />
BUT IT WENT TO SHIT CAUSE YOU LET IT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Listen -<br />

ANDY<br />
<br />
NO! IT IS MY TURN TO LET ME TALK<br />
IF YOU DON'T<br />
I'LL TAKE MY TURN TO TELL THE TRUTH<br />
IF YOU WON'T<br />
IM NOT SAYING JACK WAS WRONG, OR IM THE ONE WHO'S RIGHT<br />
BUT IT IS MY TURN TO SAY MY PIECE TONIGHT<br />
<br />
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WILL<br />
LOOK AROUND<br />
<br />
YOUR GOOD OLD GLORY DAYS<br />

<br />
(ANDY picks up the notebook up off the bleachers)<br />
<br />
AND ALL OF THESE MEMORIES WE USED TO ENJOY<br />
THE NIGHTS OUT HERE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE<br />
THE BROTHERS THAT NO ONE COULD EVER DESTROY<br />
WERE WORTH NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING!!<br />
<br />
<br />
(ANDY tears the notebook apart.)<br />
<br />
Page 76<br />
        <br />
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOYS?<br />
NOW IT IS MY TURN TO ASK YOU<br />
WHAT TO DO?<br />
<br />
WHEN AFTER FIVE YEARS <br />
I DON'T TRUST YOU<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN BROTHERS FOR SO LONG<br />
AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE - <br />
<br />
SO IT IS MY TURN - <br />
<br />
IT IS MY TURN<br />
TO GO<br />
BUT IT IS YOUR TURN<br />
TO KNOW <br />
I'VE NEVER HAD A GIFT LIKE YOURS FOR CLEVER WORDS TO SAY<br />

Andy -<br />

 <br />
What was he talking about? You lied to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
Page 77<br />
        <br />
WILL<br />
No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
About what?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything, cause I didn't want anything to get fucked up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing anyways?  Something you wanna tell me?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know.<br />
(WILL continues to pick up the pieces of the notebook)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.<br />
<br />
(SKIP kneels down to help)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Well, that's not healthy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah, maybe not.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.<br />

WILL<br />
I know, but when the hell did that happen?<br />

AND BLAMED MISTAKES ON BEING HUMAN<br />
<br />
BUT NOW WE'RE OLD<br />
AND EVEN ONE<br />
WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN<br />
<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN<br />
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND<br />
<br />
ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID<br />
ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT ALL OF US DID<br />
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER WE WERE SO SURE<br />
THAT WE'D NEVER STOP BEING BOYS ANYMORE<br />
<br />

MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID<br />
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE<br />

<br />
WILL<br />
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING<br />
<br />
Page 79<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
NOBODY IS LOSING<br />

Oh I almost forgot.<br />

<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
<br />
Page 81<br />
        <br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
<br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY<br />
<br />
Page 82<br />
        <br />
CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)<br />
<br />
<br />
THE END.<br />
<br />
GLORY DAYS<br />
