<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w22180")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w22180")' onclick='show("w22180")' id='b22180'>REMEMBER</span> WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w22181")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w22181")' onclick='show("w22181")' id='b22181'>He opens his notebook and begins to read</span>)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w22182")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w22182")' onclick='show("w22182")' id='b22182'></span>SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />

        <br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w22184")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w22184")' onclick='show("w22184")' id='b22184'>begins flipping through the pages</span> of his <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w22185")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w22185")' onclick='show("w22185")' id='b22185'>notebook</span>)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
 <br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />

Not really. No.<br />

(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />

I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />

I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />

(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />

        <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w22551")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w22551")' onclick='show("w22551")' id='b22551'>something</span>.

<br />

He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w22552")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w22552")' onclick='show("w22552")' id='b22552'></span>sorry... should I not have?<br />

No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />

It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w22553")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w22553")' onclick='show("w22553")' id='b22553'></span>   <br />

CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />

THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />

  <br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />

JACK<br />
(to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
<br />
SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

...LOOK WHO'S "SPEAKING OUT"<br />
LIKE HE KNOWS ABOUT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />

Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />

...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b22552")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b22552")' onclick='show("b22552")' id='w22552'>I'm</span> sorry... should I not have?<br />

It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />

CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />

THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />

IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />

MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />

WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />

WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />

CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />

THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />

I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />

WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
