GLORY DAYS<br />
A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />
Book by James Gardiner<br />
<br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />
Page 1<br />
<br />
    SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL begins flipping through the pages of his notebook)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
<br />
 <br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

    <br />
 SKIP<br />
Who're you talking to...?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(startled) Skip!! Heyyy!!<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL slams his notebook shut and tosses it under the bench)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(imitating) Heyyy buddy!!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's so good to see you.<br />
<br />
(WILL hugs SKIP)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You too. (beat) Where are the other fools? I thought you said midnight.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(exasperated) I know... I probably should have told them 9. (beat) What's up with your hair? <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
You like? I'm just letting nature do its thing. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(amused) You look like a girl.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, you wanna start already? Cause we can go Tubs Tubs!<br />
<br />
<br />
(SKIP playfully slaps WILL's stomach) <br />
   <br />
    <br />
    <br />
SKIP<br />
Wanna go? Let's go! Who's a girl now? Huh? Who's a girl now Tub Tubs? Wanna cry? 		<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'm joking! No. Okay, okay! No, no, no. I'm sorry. Cut it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
    <br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
HEY, look, if you don't stop I'm not gonna tell you what we're doing tonight! <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />

WILL<br />
Nope. I've got a plan. Tell me -<br />

SKIP<br />
What are we doing?  <br />

WILL<br />
I can't tell you that. <br />

SKIP<br />
Why not? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(coyly) Cause... I don't know if I trust you.<br />

<br />
    WILL<br />
FINE. DO YOU LIKE WATER RIDES?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Are we going to Sea World? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Really?!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope. But close.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
 I hate you. (beat) Is it something -?<br />
<br />
       <br />
WILL <br />
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS<br />
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO<br />
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO<br />
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU<br />
<br />
(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.)<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?  <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Superman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(to WILL) Fuck that!<br />

WILL<br />
Jaaaack!<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(sees SKIP) Hey, who's the hippie?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, nice to see you too.<br />
<br />
(ANDY hugs SKIP. Without missing a beat, ANDY tries to get SKIP's opinion on the whole Batman vs. Superman debate.)  <br />
<br />
WILL <br />
<br />
(to JACK) ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST YEAR!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
(looking around)I GOTTA SAY IT'S PRETTY WEIRD <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HOW WAS LIFE AT SCHOOL?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
PROBABLY THE SAME AS YOU<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
<br />
THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S TRUE UNLESS YOU ROOMED WITH ANDY TOO.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(to ANDY) Drop it - <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU THINK THAT BATMAN<br />
WOULD LOSE A BATTLE TO A GUY IN TIGHTS? <br />
<br />
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE GAY RED UNDIES <br />
HE WEARS OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS? <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN <br />
TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN<br />
    <br />
    Page 6<br />
<br />
BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT <br />
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What's your point?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sooo... ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT? <br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? <br />

WILL<br />
HAVE I EVER STEERED YOU WRONG? <br />

JACK<br />
Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I said I was sorry!  I'm sorry! <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL runs over to his backpack)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Slobbers? What was he doing?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
I was not! <br />

Whatever man! My sister was watching it. <br />

Oh yeaaah, how's she doing? <br />

SKIP<br />
That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me? <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I'm gonna punch you in the face - <br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Hey now, there's no need to get all huffy...it's not my fault your sister's bangin'! <br />
<br />
    ANDY<br />
She's twelve years old!  <br />

JACK<br />
Hey, whatever floats your boat, right? <br />
    <br />
    Page 8<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to JACK)My sister is not allowed to float anyone's boat!  <br />

JACK<br />
Aww, you're no fun. <br />

SKIP<br />
But your sister is! <br />

OHHHHHHH!!(raspberry <br />

ANDY<br />
(grabbing at SKIP and JACK)Come here! <br />

SKIP<br />

What? Take it as a compliment. You've got good genes!<br />

ANDY<br />
I swear to God-<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY!  <br />
    <br />

<br />
<br />
(to ANDY)Chill! Look, we've got important business to take care of - <br />
<br />
    (ANDY stops struggling and WILL releases him.<br />

ANDY<br />
I got you later!  <br />

<br />
WILL<br />
 (scolding) Okay, enough! Here. Read.<br />
<br />
(WILL hands ANDY a newspaper clipping)<br />
<br />
<br />
    Page 9<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sarcastic) A piece of paper.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Just read!<br />
<br />
(ANDY takes a look at the paper. Clears his throat and reads)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(reading) "Come one, come all to the <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37179")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37179")' onclick='show("w37179")' id='b37179'></span>Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." What<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37180")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37180")' onclick='show("w37180")' id='b37180'></span>!? FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Keep reading!<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." <br />

Wow, you read that really well! <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37181")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37181")' onclick='show("w37181")' id='b37181'>You didn't stutter or anything</span>.<br />

ANDY<br />
Shut up! (to WILL) What the hell is this? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
This,my friend, is inspiration.   <br />
<br />
    (WILL takes the paper from ANDY and walks back towards the player's bench) <br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What? <br />
    <br />
    Page 10<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh Jesus.... (i.e. "here we go again...")<br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox) <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please. <br />
<br />
(ANDY <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37182")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37182")' onclick='show("w37182")' id='b37182'>obliges, easily amused by his own improvised drum roll. His drum roll slows as the names start to land</span>) <br />

<br />
Matt Hoffman, Chris Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No shit!? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle. <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37183")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37183")' onclick='show("w37183")' id='b37183'></span>You see that box?<br />

Yup.<br />

Yeah.<br />

WILL<br />
Skip?<br />
<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Uh-huh. Box. Got it.<br />

WILL<br />
That box contains something truly magical.<br />

Is it Christmas?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
No. Better</span>. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. <br />

Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we were made fun of. For every time we were walked over or treated like shit. This is karma at its finest boys! <br />

Blown! My mind is officially blown. <br />
<br />

WILL<br />
We've waited for this moment for five years and tomorrow it's on. All we have to do is reset the timer.<br />

(extends his hand to WILL) Well done sir! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(shakes ANDY's hand) Ah thank you!<br />

ANDY<br />
I take back every time I ever called you queer. (beat) For the next five minutes.<br />

How did you get this?<br />

ANDY<br />
That's the one!<br />

JACK<br />
Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.<br />

Why'd she give it to you?<br />

SKIP<br />
No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally together in the same place. Isn't that enough? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Sorry.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Think about it. We don't have to associate ourselves with this place ever again, so why do you wanna come back and pull some stupid prank? We're past that.<br />

WILL<br />
It's not stupid! <br />

What message is that?<br />

That we deserve respect.<br />

SKIP<br />
From who?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
From them!<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh that makes a ton of sense. (beat) Will. You really think they're gonna start respecting us for setting off sprinklers during their little charity football game?<br />

WILL<br />
It's not about that - it's.... (beat) Come on, don't you think they deserve it!<br />

JACK<br />
Will it was five years ago!<br />

WILL<br />
So!? It still happened! And all because we didn't make their precious little team -<br />

SKIP<br />
Here we go. <br />

WILL<br />
They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
But Will, they're not gonna care. They never did, so why would they start now?<br />

WILL<br />
Then maybe, it's not about them! Maybe it's about us!<br />

No, I think it's more that you don't get it.<br />

ANDY<br />
Oh I get it.<br />

You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />

ANDY<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Thank you for admitting it.<br />

Yeah?<br />

Smart kid too ... he tried to create this like ventilation system out his window so the RA couldn't smell it. But somebody saw the smoke outside and called the fire department. Now he goes to community college. Fuckin' sucks.<br />

I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES<br />
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS<br />
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE<br />

AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY<br />
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS<br />
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY<br />
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY<br />
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME<br />
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST<br />
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />
<br />
AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />

AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS<br />

AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT<br />
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT<br />
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY<br />
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND<br />

    Never! My roommate was like that. He wore plaid shorts every day of the week. It'd be 15 degrees outside and he'd still be wearing plaid shorts and boat shoes. Dumbass.<br />

WILL<br />
You know what I mean. <br />

Yea, I do. But as much as I know you believe you are, you're not different. You're standing here, talking about how things should change. And not doing shit. Just like everybody else.<br />

    But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards.

I mean, was it something that you'<span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37269")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37269")' onclick='show("w37269")' id='b37269'>ve</span> always <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37270")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37270")' onclick='show("w37270")' id='b37270'>known</span> or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And I kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("w37271")' onmouseout='dehighlight("w37271")' onclick='show("w37271")' id='b37271'>long</span> beat)<br />
<br />
    Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
        <br />
        Page 65<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
    <br />
    Page 66<br />
<br />
    IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
<br />
        <br />
        Page 67<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away.  Silence.)<br />

WILL<br />

(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />

JACK<br />
(to ANDY)<br />
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS<br />
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN<br />
<br />
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE<br />
<br />
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?<br />
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE<br />
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR<br />
    <br />
    73<br />
<br />
    CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE<br />
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL<br />
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE<br />
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL<br />
<br />
(ANDY starts to walk away)<br />
<br />
SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW<br />
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS<br />
<br />
DO NOT ACCEPT <br />
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND<br />
SO, AS ONE OF THEM<br />
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
    AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY    <br />
    <br />

A New Musical<br />
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire <br />

    <br />
<br />
(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)<br />
<br />
MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
WILL<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE<br />
JUST WHITE LINES<br />
<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR TIME<br />
AND SO MUCH HISTORY<br />
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE<br />
ALL THE STORIES<br />
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN<br />
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT<br />
RIGHT HERE <br />
<br />
<br />
(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS<br />
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS<br />
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN<br />
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN<br />
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN<br />
<br />
WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN<br />
<br />
WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN<br />
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS<br />
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND<br />
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?<br />
<br />
WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH<br />
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM<br />
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH <br />
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END<br />
<br />
THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM<br />
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY<br />
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST<br />
 <br />
Page 1<br />
    SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY<br />
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM<br />
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY<br />
<br />
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
(WILL begins flipping through the pages of his notebook)<br />
<br />
SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON<br />
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC<br />
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK<br />
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX<br />
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS<br />
<br />
<br />
CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER<br />
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME<br />
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE<br />
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION<br />
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN<br />
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY<br />
<br />
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE<br />
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS<br />
<br />
   (WILL begins to write) <br />
<br />
 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND<br />
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND<br />
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR<br />
<br />
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG<br />
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG<br />
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE<br />
<br />
BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT<br />
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE<br />
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO<br />
ALMOST A YEAR AGO<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL<br />
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL<br />
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME<br />
YEA ME AND MY THREE <br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
ME AND MY THREE<br />
BEST FRIENDS<br />

 SKIP<br />
Who're you talking to...? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />

<br />
SKIP<br />
You like? I'm just letting nature do its thing. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
(amused) You look like a girl.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Oh, you wanna start already? Cause we can go Tubs Tubs!<br />

FINE. DO YOU LIKE WATER RIDES?<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Are we going to Sea World? <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Really?!<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Nope. But close.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
 I hate you. (beat) Is it something -?<br />
       <br />
WILL <br />
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS<br />
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO<br />
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO<br />
<br />
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU<br />
<br />
(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Superman.<br />
<br />

SKIP<br />
Yeah, nice to see you too.<br />

(ANDY hugs SKIP. Without missing a beat, ANDY tries to get SKIP's opinion on the whole Batman vs. Superman debate.)<br />
<br />
WILL <br />
(to JACK) ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?<br />

HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE GAY RED UNDIES <br />

SKIP<br />
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN <br />

TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN<br />
    <br />

BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT <br />
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? <br />

Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!<br />

I said I was sorry!  I'm sorry! <br />

(WILL runs over to his backpack)<br />

SKIP<br />
Slobbers? What was he doing?<br />

All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY!<br />

ANDY<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(sarcastic) A piece of paper.<br />

ANDY<br />
I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?<br />

Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own.<br />

But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures.<br />

WILL<br />
Keep reading!<br />

ANDY<br />
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside) mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." <br />

Oh Jesus.... (i.e. "here we go again...")<br />

Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please.<br />

All I'm saying is she's a sure thing. (putting his arm around WILL) And Will, buddy, you need to start taking advantage of these opportunities. Cause let's be honest, you didn't really get any this year.<br />

WILL<br />
She is not, shut up!<br />

Look, stop being a pussy. (ANDY takes out his phone) If she got em mixed up then she can bring over the right one-<br />

No, its gonna give her the wrong idea.<br />

ANDY<br />

We are.<br />

SKIP<br />
No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally together in the same place. Isn't that enough? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Sorry.<br />

SKIP<br />
Think about it. We don't have to associate ourselves with this place ever again, so why do you wanna come back and pull some stupid prank? We're past that.<br />

That we deserve respect.<br />

From who?<br />

WILL<br />
From them!<br />

Oh that makes a ton of sense. (beat) Will. You really think they're gonna start respecting us for setting off sprinklers during their little charity football game?<br />

WILL<br />
It's not about that - it's.... (beat) Come on, don't you think they deserve it!<br />

JACK<br />
Will it was five years ago!<br />

So!? It still happened! And all because we didn't make their precious little team -<br />

Here we go. <br />

They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?<br />

But Will, they're not gonna care. They never did, so why would they start now?<br />

Oh I get it.<br />

You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.<br />

ANDY<br />
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.<br />

Thank you for admitting it.<br />

WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW<br />
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE<br />
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS<br />

I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED<br />
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE<br />
ON THE OPEN ROAD<br />

AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES<br />
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE<br />
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE<br />

HE'S OUR BEST FRIEND, DON'T WE ASK THAT OF HIM?<br />
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, IT'LL JUST TAKE SOME MORE<br />
TO WORK IN OUR OLD WAY<br />
<br />
OKAY?<br />

NO<br />
I WON'T SAY I DON'T CARE<br />

OH, AND I DO?<br />

ANDY<br />
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG<br />
YOU ALWAYS SEE THE UPSIDE<br />
WHY?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
CAUSE I CAN STILL SEE HIM WHEN I LOOK AT HIS FACE<br />
HE'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT, HE'S JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE<br />
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY<br />
<br />
CAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE<br />
WHY GREET THAT CHANGE BY CAUSING HIM PAIN?<br />

I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM<br />

WHEN I FEEL ALONE, I HAVE THESE FRIENDS OF MINE<br />
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME, WHO KEEP ME SANE IN TROUBLED TIMES<br />

AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY AFTER ALL<br />

WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I ONLY HAD MYSELF<br />
TO GUIDE MY LIFELESS ACTION FIGURES TO THE FLOOR, DOWN FROM THE SHELF<br />
MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY<br />

THAT I WOULD FIND SOME REAL FRIENDS TO GUIDE ME SOMEDAY<br />

Well... there's that window in the gym. The one we used to sneak out of during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.<br />
<br />
ARE YOU READY REPRISE<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
AREN'T YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I'VE BEEN READY SINCE 5 YEARS AGO<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
TRESPASSING'S A CRIME, YOU KNOW<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
    THEN WE'LL ABORT IF COPS SHOW<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I like where your head's at.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I DUNNO...<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />

<br />
WILL<br />

NO<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />

<br />
ANDY<br />
All right. Let's fucking do this!<br />
<br />
(SKIP and ANDY exit, whooping and hollering. WILL and JACK are left alone.)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
SSShhhhhhhhhhhhh! Guys! <br />

<br />
JACK<br />
They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
(Long silence) <br />
<br />
    So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Sure. You can call it that. <br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Sorry. (beat) So is there?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No. There isn't. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What about... what's his face?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Who?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
    The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Kissed?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Not really. No.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?<br />
        <br />
        Page 64<br />
WILL<br />
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
You just did. Something else? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Yea. How long have you known? <br />
<br />
JACK<br />
About what? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
You know. I mean, was it something that you <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37269")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37269")' onclick='show("b37269")' id='w37269'></span>always <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37270")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37270")' onclick='show("b37270")' id='w37270'>knew</span> or...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(wryly) Why so curious?<br />
 <br />
WILL<br />
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And I kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.<br />
<br />
(WILL nods, <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37271")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37271")' onclick='show("b37271")' id='w37271'></span>beat)<br />
<br />
    Does that bother you?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
No, of course not. <br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What would he have said?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.<br />
        <br />
        Page 65<br />
<br />
    <br />
WILL<br />
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
What'd he say?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
<br />
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He said that?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
...Yeah.<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Should I talk to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
It's not you, Jack. It's him.<br />
<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US<br />
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN<br />
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN<br />
    <br />
    Page 66<br />
    IS NOT TOO SURPRISING<br />
<br />
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR<br />
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE<br />
<br />
WITH ANDY <br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM<br />
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
<br />
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK<br />
THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO<br />
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF<br />
<br />
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO<br />
MAYBE<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY<br />
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US<br />
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE<br />
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?<br />
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO<br />
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
BUT OBVIOUSLY<br />
THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW<br />
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK and WILL<br />
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE <br />
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...<br />
<br />
        <br />
        Page 67<br />
    <br />
JACK<br />
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...<br />
<br />
JACK AND WILL<br />
<br />
THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW<br />
A THING ABOUT<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND<br />
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
THE THING ABOUT ANDY<br />
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU<br />
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE<br />
<br />
WILL and JACK<br />
I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS<br />
THE THING ABOUT -<br />
<br />
(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away. Silence.)<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
What was that for?<br />
<br />
(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What are you doing?<br />
<br />
(JACK and WILL pull away from each other)<br />
<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
Shit. <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Will, what are you DOING?!<br />
<br />

WILL<br />
Andy - <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37272")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37272")' onclick='show("b37272")' id='w37272'></span>It was nothing.<br />

JACK<br />
<br />
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
I don't believe this.<br />
<br />
(ANDY grabs his jacket off the bleachers)<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, stop!  We need to talk about this...<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(boiling.) Will. Do. You. Realize what you just did?! <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You're right! I'm sorry. But it's not what you -<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
Fuck this.<br />

<br />
WILL<br />
Andy, come on -<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
(overlapping WILL)<br />
Andy, please, can we talk for a second?<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
<br />
(to Jack) You came here tonight and dropped this shit on us and <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37273")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37273")' onclick='show("b37273")' id='w37273'>thought</span> that everything would be fine. It's NOT fine. You lied to us -<br />

WILL<br />
Jack - <br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
What?<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
That you couldn't deal with it. That you've been sitting here all night <span class='normal' onmouseover='highlight("b37276")' onmouseout='dehighlight("b37276")' onclick='show("b37276")' id='w37276'>not saying</span> anything. Why not, why don't you just talk to me?<br />
<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) Why would you tell him that....<br />
<br />
JACK<br />
He was being a good friend, Andy. I think I have the right to know that.<br />
<br />
ANDY<br />
(to WILL) I don't believe you. <br />

(SKIP pulls a key out of his pocket and tosses it to WILL)<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
You found it.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. <br />
<br />
WILL<br />
(smiles) Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Silence)<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
(beat) Hey. I love you, ok?<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
I know. I love you too.<br />
<br />
SKIP<br />
<br />
(beat) Night buddy.<br />
<br />
WILL<br />
   Night man.<br />

<br />
MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
<br />
LOOK AT THIS FIELD<br />
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD<br />
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?<br />
THESE WHITE LINES?<br />
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE<br />
EXCEPT FOR MINE<br />
<br />
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY <br />
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE<br />
<br />
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO<br />
  <br />
  Page 81<br />
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME<br />
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW<br />
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW<br />
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW <br />
<br />
THEM BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR<br />
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE<br />
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE<br />
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER<br />
<br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT<br />
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR <br />
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT <br />
<br />
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE <br />
<br />
BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY<br />
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE<br />
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE<br />
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME<br />
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
<br />
LETS SEE<br />
IM MAKING MISTAKES<br />
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION<br />
IM GETTING LOST<br />
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION<br />
<br />
WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?<br />
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?<br />
AND WHEN AM I MAN?<br />
<br />
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN<br />
<br />
WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER<br />
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR<br />
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE <br />
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...<br />
REMEMBER...<br />
ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...<br />
<br />
<br />
(throws the key into the distance)<br />
<br />
I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY<br />
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE<br />
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"<br />
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE<br />
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY<br />
    AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY    <br />
    <br />
<br />
    Page 82<br />
    CAUSE IT'S JUST ME<br />
AND MY NEXT STORY<br />
<br />
(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)<br />
<br />
THE END.<br />
<br />
GLORY DAYS<br />
