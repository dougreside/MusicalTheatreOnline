GLORY DAYS
A New Musical
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire 
Book by James Gardiner

    

(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)

MY THREE BEST FRIENDS
WILL
LOOK AT THIS FIELD
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE
JUST WHITE LINES

NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE
EXCEPT FOR TIME
AND SO MUCH HISTORY
REMEMBER WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE
ALL THE STORIES
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT
RIGHT HERE 


(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)

THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN

WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN

WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?

WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH 
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END

THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST
SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY
2
        
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY
JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS


(WILL begins flipping through the pages of his notebook)

SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS

CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER

OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE 
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY
THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE

ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS

   (WILL begins to write) 

 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR
AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE


WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE

BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO
ALMOST A YEAR AGO
 

I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME
YEA ME AND MY THREE 
ME AND MY THREE
ME AND MY THREE
BEST FRIENDS

(SKIP THOMAS, 19, enters without WILL noticing.)

 SKIP
Who're you talking to...? 

WILL
(startled) Skip!! Heyyy!! 


(WILL slams his notebook shut and tosses it under the bench) 

SKIP
(imitating) Heyyy buddy!!

WILL
It's so good to see you.


(WILL hugs SKIP)

SKIP
You too. (beat) Where are the other fools? I thought you said midnight.

WILL
(exasperated) I know... I should have told them 9. (beat) What's up with your hair? 


SKIP
You like? I'm just letting nature do its thing. 

WILL
(amused) You look like a girl.

SKIP
Oh, you wanna start already? Cause we can go Tubs Tubs!


(SKIP playfully slaps WILL's stomach) 
   
    




        


        
	



        


        
	



            
SKIP
Wanna go? Let's go! Who's a girl now? Huh? Who's a girl now Tub Tubs? Wanna cry? 		

WILL
I'm joking! No. Okay, okay! No, no, no. I'm sorry. Cut it out.


    
    
WILL
HEY, look, if you don't stop I'm not telling you what we're gonna do tonight! 

SKIP
(stops) What we're gonna do? I thought this was it.

WILL

Nope. I've got a plan. Tell me -

ARE YOU READY

WILL
ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT? 
 4
        

SKIP
What? 

WILL
ARE YOU READY TO MAKE HISTORY? 
RIGHT HERE ON THIS FOOTBALL FIELD 
YOU AND ME 

AND TWO OTHER GUYS 
WHO COULD SHOW UP AT ANY TIME 
WHEN EVER THEY DO GET HERE, I'M
HOPING YOU'RE READY 

SKIP
What are we doing?  


WILL
I can't tell you that. 

SKIP
Why not? 

WILL
(coyly) Cause... I don't know if I trust you.


SKIP
Come on. Just tell me!

WILL
Not yet!
WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT
WE ALL WILL BE HERE FINALLY
AND WHEN WE ARE, YOU'LL FINALLY SEE
"WHAT THIS HIGH SCHOOL MEANS TO ME" 


SKIP
HOW 'BOUT A HINT?

WILL
 I SHOULD WAIT FOR ALL THE GUYS

SKIP
I'LL ACT LIKE I'M STILL SURPRISED!


WILL
FINE. DO YOU LIKE WATER RIDES?

SKIP
Are we going to Sea World? 

WILL
Yup.
 5

        

SKIP
Really?!

WILL
Nope. But close.

SKIP
 I hate you. (beat) Is it something -?  


WILL 
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU

(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.) 


ANDY
Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-

JACK
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.

ANDY
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?

JACK

 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?

ANDY
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?

WILL
Superman.

ANDY
(to WILL) Fuck that!


WILL
Jaaaack!

JACK
Wiiill! What's up!?

(WILL and JACK hug and continue their own conversation)

ANDY
(sees SKIP) Hey, who's the hippie?

 6
        

SKIP
Yeah, nice to see you too.

(ANDY hugs SKIP. Without missing a beat, ANDY tries to get SKIP's opinion on the whole Batman vs. Superman debate.)  

WILL 

(to JACK) ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT? 

JACK
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?

WILL
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST YEAR!

JACK

(looking around)I GOTTA SAY IT'S PRETTY WEIRD 

WILL
HOW WAS LIFE AT SCHOOL?

JACK
PROBABLY THE SAME AS YOU

WILL 

THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S TRUE UNLESS YOU ROOMED WITH ANDY TOO.

SKIP
(to ANDY) Drop it - 

ANDY
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU THINK THAT BATMAN
WOULD LOSE A BATTLE TO A GUY IN TIGHTS? 

HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE GAY RED UNDIES 
HE WEARS OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS? 

SKIP
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN 
TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN

BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT 

SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? 

ANDY
What's your point?

WILL
Sooo... ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT? 

SKIP

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? 
 7
        

WILL
HAVE I EVER STEERED YOU WRONG? 

SKIP

I DUNNO. IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

WILL
JUST GET READY FOR TONIGHT
AND WHAT A NIGHT IT'S GONNA BE
YOU AND YOU AND YOU AND ME

ALL
FINALLY...


WILL
BACK TOGETHER 

JACK
I'VE MISSED YOU GUYS 

ANDY (to JACK)
YOU ONLY LIKE SUPERMAN CAUSE HE FLIES


WILLNOW ARE YOU READY FOR  

ALL GUYS
READY 
FOR TONIGHT  
RIGHT 
HERE!!

WILL

What took you guys so long?


JACK
Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!

ANDY
I said I was sorry!  I'm sorry! 

(WILL runs over to his backpack)


SKIP
Slobbers? What was he doing?

JACK
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted. 

ANDY
I was not! 


ANDY
I was not! 
8
        

JACK
Slobbering all over the sofa. 

ANDY
Whatever man! My sister was watching it. 


SKIP
Oh yeaaah, how's she doing? 

(JACK laughs)
ANDY
(to SKIP) 
Don't start man -

SKIP

What!? I'm genuinely interested!

ANDY
(suspicious) She's fine. 
    
SKIP
That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me? 


ANDY
I'm gonna punch you in the face - 

SKIP
Hey now, there's no need to get all huffy...it's not my fault your sister's bangin'! 

    ANDY
She's twelve years old!


JACK
Hey, whatever floats your boat, right? 

ANDY
(to JACK)My sister is not allowed to float anyone's boat!  


JACK
Aww, you're no fun.

SKIP
But your sister is! 

SKIP and JACK
OHHHHHHH!!(raspberry

(SKIP and JACK slap high five) 

 9
        

ANDY
(grabbing at SKIP and JACK)Come here! 
    
(ANDY chases SKIP and JACK around the field) 


SKIP
What? Take it as a compliment. You've got good genes!

ANDY
I swear to God-

WILL
All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY!
    
(WILL throws his arms around ANDY to hold him back. Andy continues to struggle) 


(to ANDY)Chill! Look, we've got important business to take care of - 

    (ANDY stops struggling and WILL releases him.
    
ANDY
I got you later! 

SKIP

Oh yeah?

ANDY
Yeah, you little twinkie!

WILL
 (scolding) Okay, enough! Here. Read.


(WILL hands ANDY a newspaper clipping)

ANDY
What is this?

JACK
(sarcastic) A piece of paper.

ANDY

I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?

WILL
Just read!

(ANDY takes a look at the paper. Clears his throat and reads)
 10
        

ANDY
(reading)"Come one, come all to the Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." What!? FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! 

WILL
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own. 

ANDY
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures. 


WILL
Keep reading!

ANDY
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." 


SKIP
Wow, you read that really well! You didn't stutter or anything.

ANDY
Shut up! (to WILL) What the hell is this? 

WILL
This,my friend, is inspiration. 


    (WILL takes the paper from ANDY and walks back towards the player's bench)

ANDY
What? 

SKIP
Oh Jesus.... (i.e. "here we go again...")

(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox)


WILL
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please?

(ANDY obliges, easily amused by his own improvised drum roll. His drum roll slows as the names start to land) 

Matt Hoffman, Chris Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - 

JACK

No shit!? 
 11
        

WILL
Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle. You see that box?


(WILL points to a small weather box situated near the players bench)

    ANDY
Yup.

JACK
Yeah.

WILL

Skip?

SKIP
Uh-huh. Box. Got it.

WILL
That box contains something truly magical.

JACK
Is it Christmas?


WILL
No. Better. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. 

(WILL tosses the key to ANDY)

ANDY

(gets it) No way!

JACK 
 I don't get it.

ANDY
(amazed. To WILL) We're gonna soak the bastards!


JACK
 Why?

WILL
Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we were made fun of. For every time we were walked over or treated like shit. This is karma at its finest boys! 

ANDY
Blown! My mind is officially blown. 


(SKIP takes the key from ANDY)
 12
        

WILL
We've waited for this moment for five years and tomorrow it's on. All we have to do is reset the timer.

ANDY
(extends his hand to WILL) Well done sir!


WILL
(shakes ANDY's hand) Ah thank you!

ANDY
I take back every time I ever called you gay. (beat) For the next five minutes.

SKIP

How did you get this?

WILL
I have my sources.

JACK
Who?

WILL
I know people. 


SKIP
No you don't.

JACK
Are you gonna tell us who or not?

WILL
(a strained, pregnant beat) Patricia Wedntz.


ANDY
FAT PAT!?

SKIP
Who?

WILL
(to SKIP, referencing ANDY) Exactly why I didn't want to tell you!


ANDY
You don't remember PAT!? Sophomore last year, redhead? She's the janitor's niece. Kinda ... thick?

WILL
Andy - 
 13
        

ANDY

What!?

WILL
Don't call her thick!

ANDY
I'm creating a visual. 

JACK
You did just call her Fat Pat.


SKIP
(to WILL) Wait, is this the girl who asked you to homecoming, but you said no for religious reasons? 

ANDY
That's the one!

JACK
Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.


SKIP
Why'd she give it to you?

WILL
(a slight hesitation) Cause she was being nice.

ANDY
(joking) Yeah right! What'd you do, take her out on a date?


WILL
(caught off guard) No, it wasn't a - (stops mid sentence. Catches himself)

ANDY
What?

WILL
Huh?


ANDY
It wasn't a what?

WILL
What?

ANDY
 Oh sweet Lord Jesus NO! (beat) You DID!


WILL
No I - No. (pause) It wasn't a date. 
 14
        

ANDY

(hardly controlling himself) Then what was it?

WILL
We just went out to eat.

ANDY
To EAT!? That's an operation. Where'd you take her? Arby's? No wait! No no wait I got it - it's coming to me - where would you take her so no one would see you AND your jew ass could feed her for cheap.... Denny's!

(WILL remains silent.)


ANDY
(laughing hysterically) Yes!!! I knew it! What'd she get? I have to know. 

WILL
Andy, really?

ANDY
A steak, or three? Some cheeseburgers? Maybe a nice little Chocolate Brownie Fudge Delight with some extra fixins?


JACK
Sprinkles!

ANDY
Oh we are beyond sprinkles my friend! You KNOW that girl can throw down! We're talking marshmallows, butter scotch, peanuts, candy corn, pop corn... maybe some real corn -

JACK
Ewww.

ANDY

Hot fudge, a couple bananas for potassium -

WILL
 You're a real jerk, you know that? 

ANDY
Ah come on man. I'm just playing! Look, I'm seriously proud of you! She's a catch.

WILL
She's not a catch and you know it!


ANDY
Why?

WILL
Cause she's...
 15
        
    
ANDY

...Fat? That's fucked up Will.

(JACK laughs at this)
WILL
 I didn't say that. You're the one calling her fat!

ANDY
All I'm saying is she's a sure thing. (putting his arm around WILL) And Will, buddy, you need to start taking advantage of these opportunities. Cause let's be honest, you didn't really get any this year.


WILL
(pushing ANDY away) Just cuz I didn't want any of the diseased skanks that you and your frat brothers hooked up with doesn't mean I didn't get any.

ANDY
What are you talking about? Those girls were prime real estate!

SKIP
Woah, woah, woah. I'm sorry. You joined a frat? 


ANDY
(proudly) Hells yeah manio! Delta Kai Epsilon! Deke Men - Class of 2010 baby!
  
SKIP
Oh no. 

WILL
I know. Of all things. (points to ANDY) HUGE hypocrite!


ANDY
ME? WHY!?

WILL
Cause it goes against everything we stand for.

SKIP
And it's just lame.

ANDY

You're lame!

JACK
Isn't that kinda like buying your friends? 

ANDY
(offended) No! It's about a brotherhood. A fellowship! A bond! 

 16

        

WILL
That you pay for.

ANDY
Whatever man, all I know is I was getting some high quality poon this year while you were sitting alone in your room jerkin the gherkin! 

WILL
I was not.


ANDY
Oh really? Why don't you tell Jack and Skip how many girls you boofed this year?

WILL
They don't care.

SKIP
I'm kind of interested.

ANDY

Well I'll tell you! The answer is zero. None! Nada! He couldn't get a single girl to touch his little Jewish ding-a-ling.

WILL
That's not true. 

ANDY
Uh, okay, then. How many?

WILL
I don't know... like... probably... 15.


SKIP
(amazed) Really?

WILL
Yeah really... maybe even 20.

JACK
Wow man, good for you!


ANDY
Bullshit!! (to SKIP and JACK) He's lying!

WILL
I am not!

ANDY
(to SKIP and JACK) I've been with him the whole year. He hasn't even talked to 15 girls.

 17
        

WILL
You don't have to talk to 'em when you're doing it.

SKIP
He's got a point! 

ANDY

You're so full of shit.

WILL
Don't be hurt.

ANDY
I'm not!

WE'VE GOT GIRLS
ANDY

ANDY

(ANDY laughs)

ANDY
Don't lie Will, it makes you look bad.

WILL
Hey, I'm not saying I'm the best looking guy around. I never used to get any, but things change, Andy. Things change. 

WILL
IN HIGH SCHOOL, GIRLS WERE OUT OF MY LEAGUE AND I KNEW IT


JACK
That's right peanut dick!

WILL
ONE AWKWARD GLANCE OR THEY'D SEE ME DANCE AND I BLEW IT

ANDY AND WILL
YOU ARE THE OPPOSITE OF ME
IM MORE THAN HAPPY TO AGREE

WILL
If you've hooked up with so many girls, then why are you always jacking off?

ANDY
Cause your Mom is constantly on my mind.


WILL
Shut up!

(WILL lunges at ANDY)
    
SKIP
Come on guys!

(WILL manages to pin ANDY to the ground)


ANDY
That's funny- this is your Mom's favorite position too.

WILL
(punches ANDY) Jerk!

(SKIP pulls WILL off of ANDY. JACK helps ANDY off the ground)

JACK

You guys haven't changed a bit.

ANDY
You're right, Will's still a lying sack of shit!

WILL
At least I have a sack! Pussy. 

(ANDY rushes at WILL. SKIP holds him back. JACK grabs WILL)
 20

        

SKIP
Knock it off. Man, you guys can't fight for shit.

JACK
Come on! Don't you two want nice, sane things? Like love?

WILL
(ANDY "poontang's" throughout)

OF COURSE WE WANT TO BE IN LOVE
AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR ROMANCE
BUT TIL WE FIND THAT LONESOME DOVE

ANDY AND WILL

    (ANDY and WILL sing into the night)

ANDY

Oh things have grown.... (smiles) 

SKIP
You're an idiot.
   21
        
    
JACK

I can't believe you two lived in the same room for a whole year.

WILL
It was hard sometimes. (points to ANDY) He never showers.

ANDY
Shut up dude!

WILL

Maybe once a week.

ANDY
Whatever, I was a great roommate.

JACK
I wouldn't want to live with you. 

ANDY

Why!? (puts his hand on JACK) We could be bunk buddies! (JACK shrugs him off)

WILL
Can you imagine if the four of us had actually lived together? I mean if we had all gone to the same school.

ANDY
That would've been tight! The four of us in a suite, trading bitches like Pokemon cards!


JACK
Sorry for ruining your dream.

WILL
I mean, just think of all the stuff we could've pulled on a college campus. 

SKIP
You mean stupid pranks like this one?

WILL

What are you talking about? This is going to be epic! We're going to go down in history for this.

SKIP
With who? No one's even gonna know we did it!

WILL
Um, we'll know.

(WILL takes the key and walks over to the box)

ANDY

(to SKIP) What is your problem, Debbie Downer?
 22
        

SKIP
Excuse me?

ANDY

You. Anytime there's any risk involved you turn into little miss Negative Nancy!

SKIP
No I don't! 

ANDY
Yes you do! Seriously, I thought you were gonna wet yourself that time we took out your Dad's Jeep.

SKIP
That was my idea!


ANDY
Yeah, but you were sweatin' beads the whole time. "I dunno guys, maybe we should abort..."

WILL
Andy -	

JACK
To be fair, his dad is pretty frightening.

ANDY

Yea, but who says abort?

SKIP
My dad's in the military, jackass!

ANDY
Yeah, but you're not! Nobody said you had to speak douchebag!

WILL
Andy, will you shut up for a second! 


ARE YOU READY REPRISE
WILL
ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT?

SKIP
AREN'T WE ALREADY HERE?

ANDY
DID ANYBODY GET THE BEER?


WILL
WE'LL DRINK IT WHEN WE'RE IN THE CLEAR
 23
        

SO GET READY FOR TONIGHT
AND WHAT A NIGHT ITS GONNA BE
YOU AND YOU AND YOU AND ME


(The boys move over to the box)

 ALL
FINALLY...

(WILL turns the key, but -)

WILL
Shit! 


ANDY
What? 

WILL
It won't open.
 
ANDY
Yes it will.


WILL
No, actually, it won't.

ANDY
Get outta the way! You don't know how to turn a goddamn key.

(ANDY pushes WILL out of the way)

Here. See you gotta turn it to the left you dil-

(ANDY tries to turn the key, but the lock won't budge)


You gotta turn it - to the -

(ANDY tries again, but the lock still won't budge)
    
You gotta - 

WILL
Yes? 

ANDY

 Motherfucker!

WILL
Told you.
 24
        

JACK
What's wrong?


ANDY
(to WILL) You got the wrong key! 

WILL
I got the wrong key!? This is what she gave me. 

ANDY
God damn it FAT PAT! 


WILL
Andy -

ANDY
You got scammed by a plus sized hooker! 

WILL
She probably just got em mixed up.
  

JACK
Can you call her?

WILL
What? No!

ANDY
Why not?

WILL

You call her!

ANDY
Why the hell would I call her? She's your girlfriend!

WILL
She is not, shut up!

ANDY
Look, stop being a pussy. (ANDY takes out his phone) If she got em mixed up then she can bring over the right one-


(ANDY tosses his phone to WILL)

WILL
No, its gonna give her the wrong idea.

(WILL tosses the phone back to ANDY)
 25
        

ANDY
Just tell her to put down the pork chops and get over here-

(ANDY tosses the phone to WILL)

WILL
I'm not doing it!

(WILL tosses the phone back to ANDY)

ANDY

Well I guess we can't do the prank then.

(ANDY tosses the phone to WILL)

WILL
Andy! 

(WILL tosses the phone to ANDY. SKIP catches it)
  
SKIP

Jesus, you guys are like a pair of three year olds. who cares!?

WILL
What do you mean who cares? 

ANDY
What are we supposed to do now?

SKIP
Why don't we try hanging out for a change? You ever think of that?


ANDY
We are.

SKIP
No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally in the same place again. Isn't that enough? 

WILL
(beat) Sorry.


SKIP
Think about it. We don't have to associate ourselves with this place ever again, so why do you wanna come back and pull some stupid prank? We're past that.

WILL
It's not stupid! 
 26
        

SKIP

(looking for support) Jack?

JACK
(to WILL) I'm with him on this one, sorry.

WILL
Guys! Andy? Help me out here.


ANDY
I mean, yeah, I still think it'd be funny as shit. 

WILL
And it sends a message. (the boys are unconvinced) It does!

SKIP
What message is that?

 
WILL
That we deserve respect.

SKIP
From who?

WILL
From them!


SKIP
Oh that makes a ton of sense. (beat) Will. You really think they're gonna start respecting us for setting off sprinklers during their charity football game?

WILL
It's not about that - it's.... (beat) Come on, don't you think they deserve it!

JACK

Will it was five years ago!

WILL
So!? It still happened! And all because we didn't make their precious little football team -

SKIP
Here we go. 

WILL

They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?

SKIP
But Will, they're not gonna care. They never did, so why would they start now?
 27
        

WILL
Then maybe, it's not about them! Maybe it's about us!


RIGHT HERE 

WILL
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
DIDN'T YOU HAVE DREAMS THAT YOU LET GO OF
CUZ SOMEBODY TOLD YOU THAT YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DREAM
THE WAY YOU DO
JUST CUZ YOU WERE DIFFERENT


LIKE
WHEN I WAS 12 
I BOUGHT MYSELF SOME LA LIGHTS
REMEMBER, THOSE SHOES THAT YOU COULD SEE AT NIGHT
CUZ BRIAN NOONAN RULED AND HE WORE THEM TO SCHOOL 
AND I HATED HIM
BUT I WANTED TO BE COOL 
ANDY
OR 

IN 7TH GRADE
I STARTED SAYING "CHILLIN BRO"
EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T COLD
CAUSE ERIC SPENCER SAID EVERYONE ELSE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT
AND IF I DIDN'T 
I'D LOOK LIKE A TOOL

WILL
THAT'S WHAT I USED TO THINK

RIGHT WHEN I WAS ON THE BRINK
OF BEING JUST ANOTHER KINK IN THEIR SOCIAL REGIME
BUT MY LIFE GOT TURNED AROUND 
WHEN I FOUND I GOT CUT FROM THEIR FOOTBALL TEAM

RIGHT HERE WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT HOME
WITH NO FEAR OF MY LIFE SPENT ALL ALONE 
IT WAS CLEAR UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS 
THAT NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAW FROM OVER THERE 

THIS FIELD WAS OURS 
RIGHT HERE 
SKIP
(sarcastic) Well that's touching.

WILL
Come on man, you used to love this stuff.

SKIP

Used to! I'd like to think I've changed a little since I left this place.
 28
        

WILL
No, this place made us who we are! 

SKIP

YOU WISH
YOU'D NEVER CHANGE
AND YOU'D ALWAYS BE IN THAT SAME EPIC MOMENT
BUT YOU MOVED AWAY
AND YOU CAN PRAY THAT THEY'LL STAY
BUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS SAY GOODBYE
AND SADLY, YOU ARE DIFFERENT

WILL

NO! WE ARE STILL YOUNG
   
AND THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE TRIED TO RID OUR LIVES
 OF THE COOL PEOPLE'S BULLSHIT
 THE BRUISES TO PROVE THAT IT STUNG ARE STILL HERE
 CAUSE WE'RE STILL DIFFERENT
JACK

OH PLEASE, LET'S LET THIS BE
CUZ BOTH OF YOU ARE WRONG RIGHT NOW
WE ALL CHANGE AND AREN'T SURE HOW 
BUT I DON'T CARE WHAT IT TOOK TO GET ME TO HERE FROM THERE
I MAY BE DIFFERENT
BUT IM STILL ME I SWEAR

WILL
YOU ARE RIGHT, BUT SO AM I

WE CAN CHANGE, BUT CAN'T DENY
WE'LL ALWAYS BE THE GUYS WE WERE WHEN WE MET 
AND BACK WHEN YOU BEGAN IT
YOU DIDN'T PLAN IT 
BUT YOU CANT FORGET

RIGHT HERE WAS THE FIRST PLACE YOU FELT HOME
 WITH NO FEAR OF A LIFE SPENT ALL ALONE
 CUZ ITS CLEAR UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS, THAT


JACK and WILL
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE FROM OVER THERE

WILL
THIS IS OURS

JACK, WILL and ANDY
RIGHT...

SKIP(WITH THE GUYS BEHIND HIM)

HERE WAS THE FIRST PLACE I FELT HOME 
 29
        

WITH NO FEAR OF MY LIFE SPENT ALL ALONE
CUZ ITS CLEAR UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS

   ALL THE GUYS

 IT ONLY MATTERS WHAT YOU SEE
RIGHT HERE 
IS A BETTER PLACE THAN HOME
CUZ ITS CLEAR THAT WE'LL NEVER BE ALONE
AND THIS YEAR UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS
EVERYONE WILL SEE FROM OVER THERE
THAT WE ARE
RIGHT HERE


WILL
So... are we doing this or what? 

JACK
Yeah.

WILL
Skip?

SKIP

Fiiiiine....

ANDY
FUCK YEAH!! 

SKIP
But how are we getting into this box?

(Silence. ANDY, JACK, and SKIP look at WILL)

ANDY

Will?

WILL
(sigh) Fine.  I'll call her. 

(WILL takes out his phone and dials)

ANDY

That's my boy. Take one for the team!

WILL
I'm always taking one for the team. (into the phone) Hi, Patty? 

SKIP
I'm sorry... Patty?
 30

        

ANDY
HAHA! FATTY PATTY!

(Throughout WILL's phone call the boys do everything they can to distract him. Sexual sounds, etc.)

WILL
(glares at SKIP) It's Will! Hi. I'm fine. Listen, I'm calling because there seems to have been a bit of a mix up. The key that you gave me doesn't work. Yeah, nope.  So I was just wondering if there was any possibility - (beat) Oh, really!? No, that would be amazing! Thank you. (beat) Uh... Friday?


ANDY
(giving it to Friday and hard) Oh yeah, Friday!

WILL
Umm... I'm actually kinda busy then... (looking to the guys for help) 

ANDY

No you're not...

WILL
(looking to the guys for help) I just -I got in a car accident yesterday, so... I'm injured. Injured bad. 

(SKIP, ANDY and JACK begin imitating sirens, screaming children, etc)

Yea I'll be okay, just broke a few bones. Sure. Yeah just give me a call back okay. Great! Thanks!

ANDY

What was that?

WILL
Cover. 

JACK 
What'd she say?

WILL 

She's babysitting right now, so she's going to look and see what she can find. She said she'd call me back.

SKIP
So we're just waiting?

WILL
I guess so.
 31
        

ANDY
Dammit.

(Silence)

JACK
I feel like we should have brought a board game or something. 

ANDY
Like Jenga!?


WILL
Jenga's not a board game!

JACK
I was thinking more along the lines of like Monopoly.

ANDY
I hate Monopoly.

SKIP

You would.

ANDY
What is that supposed to mean?

SKIP
You're just not a Monopoly kinda guy. 

ANDY
Yea, cuz I hate it.


SKIP
No, I think it's more that you don't get it.

ANDY
Oh I get it.

SKIP
No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you have. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.

ANDY

Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.

SKIP
Thank you for admitting it.

JACK
My roommate started a board game club in our dorm room. Didn't even ask.

 32

        

ANDY
What a dick! What games?

JACK
Just one. Clue.

SKIP
Ohhh Lord. I can only imagine the people who wanted to join that club.


JACK
Actually there were only five kids who kept coming back, but Jesus Christ they were annoying. They called themselves "the Clue Crew."

ANDY
That's freakin weird dude. Your roommate sounds worse then Will.

WILL
Shut up!

JACK

He was fine. I only had to put up with him for a little while.

WILL
Why? 

ANDY
Did he get kicked out?

JACK
No...


ANDY
Cause this kid on our floor got kicked out for smoking weed in his room. (to WILL) Remember Stevey?

WILL
Yeah?

ANDY
Smart kid too ... he tried to create this like ventilation system out his window so the RA couldn't smell it. But somebody saw the smoke outside and called the fire department. Now he goes to community college. Fuckin' sucks.


(A moment of silence. No one really understands the point of Andy's story or how it relates to the conversation at hand. Will chooses to ignore it all together, as if it had never happened)

WILL
(to JACK) What happened to him?
 33
        

JACK

Nothing.

WILL
Then why did you only put up with him for a little while?

JACK
I didn't see him as much.

WILL
Why not?


JACK
Just cause.

SKIP
Wow, you're being awfully descriptive.

JACK
Well... (pause) I don't know. Ok. Actually I left before the semester ended. So....


SKIP
(beat) What? 

ANDY
Woah, woah, woah. Hold the phone... what ? 

JACK
I left.


ANDY
Just...left?

JACK
Yeah.

SKIP
Where did you go?

JACK

I took a road trip.

ANDY
GET OUT! 

SKIP
That's awesome! 

WILL
Why didn't you tell us?

 34
        

JACK
I don't know. It wasn't a big deal.

ANDY
Are you shitting me?! That's huge!

SKIP

How long were you gone?

JACK
A little over a month... I got back like three weeks ago. 

SKIP
Wow, that's awesome! I'm jealous.

WILL
Wait...you've been home for three weeks? Why didn't you call us? (referencing ANDY too) We've been home.


JACK
I know. 

WILL
I thought you were still at school. Did you not want us to know you were back?

JACK
No Will, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just needed some time alone.

ANDY

Well, I don't care, I wanna know everything! Where'd you go? What'd you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!

JACK
Everything?

ANDY
Yeah.

JACK
Okay...


THE OPEN ROAD

JACK
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE

ANDY
You kissed your Mom Dude? Gross...  

 35
        

JACK
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT
BUT I DIDN'T CARE
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY



AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN
I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME
AND THE OPEN ROAD


I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY
AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST

WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS
I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE
ON THE OPEN ROAD

AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE

SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE

AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND
AND WE WENT DRIVING
WE WERE DRIVING

WE WERE DRIVING
JUST ME
A BEAUTIFUL BOY
AND THE OPEN ROAD

(Silence)

SKIP
Have you told your mom yet?
 36

        

JACK
Yup.

SKIP
What'd she say?

JACK
She said she always knew -


SKIP
So did I.

JACK
- which was annoying.

SKIP
Oh. Sorry.

JACK

That's okay. 

SKIP
(pause) Well... that's huge man, I'm really proud of you!

(SKIP hugs JACK)
JACK
Thanks.


(SKIP stares at WILL) 

WILL
What? Oh. No, yeah that's awesome! I'm sorry... it's just... new. 

JACK
For me too.

WILL
It's great though!


ANDY
Yeah -

JACK
Thanks. (beat) Is this going to be okay?

SKIP
Of course.


JACK
I just don't want anything to change. You guys are my best friends and that's absolutely the last thing I want. 
 37
        

WILL
It won't.	


JACK
Okay. Good.

(silence)
    
SKIP
Well I don't know about you fellas, but I think this calls for a celebration! Everybody ready to get drunk?

JACK
Absolutely.


SKIP
Great! Who's coming with me to the car?

WILL
You already got it?

SKIP
Of course. Always a step ahead, my friend! 

JACK

I'll help.

SKIP
Amazing. (to WILL and ANDY) Back in a flash! 

(SKIP and JACK exit. Long silence)

WILL

    (to ANDY) Wow. (beat) Well... I wasn't expecting that.

(Silence. ANDY is sitting on the player's bench staring at the ground)

Andy?

ANDY

Yeah?

WILL
You all right?

ANDY
Mhmm.

WILL
You sure?

 38
        

ANDY
Yeah.

WILL
What's wrong?

ANDY

Nothing.

WILL
Please. I know you.

ANDY
(biting) Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

WILL

You don't look fine.

ANDY
Well... (beat) are you?

WILL
Yeah.

ANDY

Really?

WILL
(unconvinced) Yeah. I mean... of course I am...yeah.

ANDY
It doesn't bother you?

WILL

No... It bothers you?

ANDY
(boiling) Yeah... it does.

WILL
Are you serious?


THINGS ARE DIFFERENT 

ANDY
DON'T LOOK AT ME THAT WAY
I'M NOT CRAZY
THIS IS MY LIFE TOO
AND IT IS NOT A GAME
IF IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU
 39

        

THAT HE'S CHANGING, FINE
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT HIM
IT DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME
JACK IS GONE TO ME
I JUST WATCHED HIM DISAPPEAR
IT MAY BE WRONG 
BUT I'M NOT STAYING HERE


WILL
Don't...

ANDY
WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

WILL
JUST DON'T GO
I KNOW IT'S NEW 

BUT WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO LEAVE JUST CUZ HE'S OPENED UP
HE'S OUR BEST FRIEND, DON'T WE ASK THAT OF HIM?
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, IT'LL JUST TAKE SOME MORE
TO WORK IN OUR OLD WAY
OKAY?

ANDY
NO
I WON'T SAY I DON'T CARE

I LOOK AND MY FRIEND ISNT THERE
I DON'T LIKE BEING LIED TO

WILL
OH, AND I DO?

ANDY
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
YOU ALWAYS SEE THE UPSIDE
WHY?


WILL
CAUSE I CAN STILL SEE HIM WHEN I LOOK AT HIS FACE
HE'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT, HE'S JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY
CAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE
WHY GREET THAT CHANGE BY CAUSING HIM PAIN?

ANDY
I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM


WILL
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT YOU WILL?
 40
        

ANDY
LOOK, THIS ISNT MY BURDEN

WILL

YOU'RE HIS FRIEND

LOOK, IM NOT SAYING I DISAGREE
BUT PLEASE, FOR ME, KEEP QUIET
 41

        

ANDY
Fine.

WILL
Fine.

(ANDY walks up the bleachers, while WILL walks down the field. The distance between them should be significant. JACK and SKIP enter carrying two cases of Natty Light)

SKIP

The pride parade is back!

(JACK and ANDY don't laugh at this. The tension between them seems pretty obvious. JACK and SKIP set the cases on the player's bench.)

WILL
What did you get?

SKIP
Only the best for my boys! Natty Light!

(SKIP tosses a can of Natty Light to WILL)


WILL
(sarcastic) Mmm... Did you steal these from your Dad's fridge?

SKIP
Nope! (proudly) I Bought em.

WILL

How?

SKIP
THIS guy!

(SKIP flashes a fake ID)

WILL
Let me see that.

(SKIP hands the ID to WILL)

SKIP
(recites the info from memory) Julio Mendez. 5225 Ridgemont Court. Ironwood, Minnesota.   September 7th, 1983.
 42
        

JACK
Impressive.


SKIP
I know.

WILL
This looks nothing like you.

SKIP
Sure it does!

WILL

No it doesn't. This kid is Hispanic. 

SKIP
Well it worked didn't it?

(SKIP takes his ID away from WILL)

JACK
(grabbing a beer) You know, I didn't have a single drop of alcohol this past year, and wonder of wonders, I'm still sane.


SKIP
Yeah but you're gay. See what sobriety can do to you? 

JACK
Dick.

SKIP
No, that's for you. (noticing ANDY on the bleachers) Whatcha doing up there, champ? (offers ANDY a can) You want one?

ANDY

Sure.

SKIP
K. Catch? (ANDY doesn't respond) Fine, come get it yourself then. (beat) What's his deal?

(SKIP sets the beer down on the player's bench. ANDY eventually walks down to get it.)
WILL

(WILL, covering, takes a sip.) This stuff is terrible!

SKIP
Then don't drink it.

WILL
Just saying, I thought you had better taste then this.
 43

        

SKIP
Listen, I had ten dollars.  For ten dollars, this is quality.

WILL
    Touche.

JACK
(to WILL) Did what's her face call?


WILL
Nope.

SKIP
How long are we gonna to wait around for this girl?

WILL
I don't know. You got places to be?

SKIP

No, I just don't wanna be out here all night! That's all!

ANDY
Amen to that.

(Silence. Will tries to cover the awkwardness again.) 

WILL
(to JACK, about SKIP) So what do you think of this new look?


JACK
I wasn't gonna say anything but, you kinda look like a pothead. 

WILL
I think he looks like a woman. 

(WILL and JACK laugh at this)

SKIP
You know what? I don't really care if it looks good or not. 


WILL
You should.

SKIP
Why? Who am I trying to impress?

ANDY
Not us, apparently. 
Page 44

        

JACK
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised. I thought you were gonna come back looking like a total Ivy Leauge prep. You know, pink polo with the popped collar...

SKIP
Never! My roommate was like that. He wore plaid shorts every day of the week. It'd be 15 degrees outside and he'd still be wearing  shorts and boat shoes. Dumbass.

JACK
Really!?


SKIP
Yeah. God, that kid. Whatever.

WILL
Sounds like your kind of guy.

SKIP
Not to mention the fact that his dad bought him a Lexus when he graduated from high school. 

JACK

Jesus. I got a check from my grandma that bounced.

SKIP
And the worst part about it is he thinks he's entitled to those things. Like he's owed something for doing nothing. Whatever. It's not worth wasting breath over. 

WILL
Did that come with the hair too?

SKIP
What?


WILL
The "Whatever." You've said it like twenty times in the last two minutes.

SKIP
Sorry.

WILL
I just expect more from you. This kid used to be your worst enemy and all you've got is "whatever"? 

SKIP

What do you want me to say? He hasn't worked a day in his life and still he gets whatever he wants, and it sucks. But nothing I'm gonna do is gonna change that, so why get all upset over it?

JACK
...When you can just grow your hair out.
 45
        

SKIP
Exactly! Hence, the "whatever." 


WILL
Since when have you ever backed down from a character debate?

SKIP
Since I saw how pointless they are. Look, I can bitch and moan all I want about him... about anything... but ultimately it doesn't do shit. It's just one opinion. 

WILL
What?! This coming from the most opinionated guy I know.

JACK

What about Ghandi?

SKIP
(confused) What about Ghandi?

JACK
Think about all the shit he did. That was just one dude!

SKIP
Yeah, but Ghandi didn't live in an age of iPods and On Demand. People would rather sit on their asses and wait for someone else to do what they'd rather not do themselves, just because they can. My roommate isn't any different. So why should I be?


WILL
Because you are. You always have been. It's why we're friends.

SKIP
 I thought we were friends because we sucked at football.

WILL
You know what I mean. 


SKIP
(sarcastic) You mean changing the world and all that.

WILL
Yes! All that.

SKIP
Aww, Will, that's cute. But what are you actually doing to CHANGE it? Nothing. Talking on a football field. And that's what makes you just like all the rest of us.


GENERATION APATHY

IN A WORLD THAT DEFINES ITSELF WITH X's Y2K's and Z's
YOU'RE PRESENT FOR A 3RD WORLD WAR

(WILL pulls his phone out of his pocket and walk aways)

SKIP
(to WILL) Where are you going?


WILL
(agitated) Calling Patricia.

SKIP
Are you mad at me?

WILL
No, I just wanna know where she is. 


(WILL walks down the field, away from the guys and starts to call Patricia.)

SKIP
(to JACK and ANDY) Wow, he's being moody tonight.

(WILL closes his phone and puts it back in his pocket)

AFTER ALL


WILL
WHEN I FEEL ALONE, I HAVE THESE FRIENDS OF MINE
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME, WHO KEEP ME SANE IN TROUBLED TIMES
AND WHEN I LOSE MY WAY, I HAVE THEM THERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND
AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY AFTER ALL

WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I ONLY HAD MYSELF
TO GUIDE MY LIFELESS ACTION FIGURES TO THE FLOOR, DOWN FROM THE SHELF
MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY

THAT I WOULD FIND SOME REAL FRIENDS TO GUIDE ME SOMEDAY
AND NOW

WHEN I FEEL ALONE, I HAVE THESE FRIENDS OF MINE
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME, WHO KEEP ME SANE IN TROUBLED TIMES
AND WHEN I LOSE MY WAY, I HAVE THEM THERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND
AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY
WHEN I FEEL ALONE 

 48

        

THEY'VE ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS ON ALL THE THINGS WE SAID WE LOVED
CAUSE EVERYONE'S DECIDED THAT THIS ISNT WHAT IT WAS
WELL NOBODY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT WE'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IM THE ONE WHO'S STILL THE SAME
AND NOW

I AM STILL ALONE WITH ALL THESE FRIENDS OF MINE
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME WHO RAN AWAY IN TROUBLED TIMES

AND NOW I FEEL THE SHAME OF HOLDING ONTO WHAT'S NO LONGER MINE
MAYBE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AFTER ALL
AND I JUST NEVER SAW IT AT ALL

(SKIP notices WILL's notebook under the bench)

SKIP
What's that? 

JACK

What? 

(SKIP picks up the notebook)

SKIP
(reads) "The Personal Memoirs of William Frances Levinson." Ooooh nooo... 

JACK
Frances!! 


(He starts flipping through the pages of the notebook)

ANDY
What are you doing? 

SKIP
Exploring. 

(WILL runs over)


WILL
Don't!

SKIP
What?

WILL
Please don't read that.

SKIP

Why?
 49
        

WILL
Cause it's none of your business.

SKIP
(flipping through the pages of the notebook) Is this a diary? 


WILL
No.

(SKIP reads)

SKIP
(reading) "The cabinet door had been left unlocked... big mistake."

WILL

(reaching for the notebook) Skip -

SKIP
(smacking WILL's hand away as he reads) "I had been explicitly warned against going anywhere near my father's liquor cabinet. I knew the punishment would be severe, somewhere between grounding and death, but it was a risk I was willing to take -" 

WILL
Look, could you not. It's private- 


SKIP
Private? Like...a diary?

WILL
It's not a diary!

SKIP
Well then you won't mind if I read it. (reading) "I stared in awe at a row of glistening bottles on the top shelf, with names like Southern Comfort, Bristol Cream, and Wild Turkey. I chose the Comfort, and the boys dared me to take the first sip. " (to WILL) What is this? 


WILL
It's nothing, okay? 

SKIP
Is this about us? 

WILL
Maybe. (beat)  Yeah.


SKIP
(flipping through the pages) There's a lot here. 

WILL
(embarrassed) Yea. I know. 
 50

        

SKIP
When did you write all this?

WILL
At school.

ANDY
Is that why you were in the room so much? I always thought you were jerking off.


WILL
Well...that too.

JACK
Let me see! 

(SKIP hands the notebook to JACK)

ANDY
What's it for?


WILL
Nothing- it's stupid - it's just -  

JACK
(reading) "Chapter One. Football Tryouts."

SKIP
You wrote about tryouts!? 


JACK
(reading) "There was no real reason why we should have become friends. What tied us together was the fact that we were uncommon."

(Lighting shift w/ underscoring. This moment should be treated as an almost out of body experience. The one moment in the show that is taken out of real time)

(reading) "Jack Moyer was incredibly small for his age and was constantly teased about it. During the first week of school, he had been targeted by a group of seniors who periodically stuffed him in one of the trashcans on the 2nd floor. By the time he'd get to eighth period he was covered in pencil shavings and smelled a lot like rotten milk." 


    SKIP
(reading) "Skip Thomas was a military brat who had lived in 5 different countries before the age of 14. His father was a high-ranking officer in the United States Army. He expected his children to call him sir and he called them men, before they even knew how to shave."

JACK
(reading) "When I first met Jack, he was wearing baggy sweatpants and a jersey that was almost twice his size, in what could only be construed as an attempt to compensate for his lack of... muscle mass?!"
 51

        

SKIP
(reading) "At tryouts, Skip marched out from the locker room, complete with a GI Joe style crew cut, stopping only to stand at attention whenever a coach passed by."

ANDY
(reading) "Andy Scott lived on the corner of Woodmont and Great Oak Road with his three older brothers and younger sister."


SKIP
HOT sister!

(ANDY punches SKIP in the arm and continues to read)

ANDY
"His father was a star quarterback for the OSU Buckeyes and his brothers had all played varsity football for the Beavers..."

JACK
(reading) "All I could think was that Jack bore a striking resemblance to ... Popeye??" What? "Without the pads he was a scrawny little runt, but when he put them on he instantly looked like he'd eaten all his spinach."


SKIP
(reading) "Oh, and lest I forget the most important detail - Skip wasn't his real name either. We quickly called him that after he was introduced to us as..." 

ANDY
Say it.

SKIP
No.


JACK
Come on, say it.

SKIP
(embarrassed, unintelligible) Hopper....

ANDY
I'm sorry. What was that? 


SKIP
(a little louder) Hopper...

ANDY
One more time.

SKIP
(biting) Hopper!! Hopper Fucking Thomas!! Like a stupid little bunny!!!

 52
        

ANDY 
OHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

JACK
Yeah, your parents really weren't thinking long term with that one.


(JACK and ANDY are both laughing at this)

SKIP
Screw you guys. I was named after my grandfather.

JACK
Your grandfather's name was Hopper? 

SKIP
Norman Hopper.


JACK
Why didn't they just name you Norman?

SKIP
I don't know. I wasn't there! Shut up!

ANDY
Let me read!  (reading) "Andy seemed destined for athletic glory. Except for one minor problem. He was a terrible athlete. He failed at every sport he tried and his father and brothers never let him forget it. In an attempt to win their respect, Andy tried out for the JV football squad. But on the first day of tryouts Andy managed to run the ball into the wrong end zone. Twice."


(Everyone except ANDY laughs at this)

ANDY
Whatever man! At least I touched the ball. You guys didn't even make it past wind sprints. (reading) "The seniors called him Conan, but I don't think Andy ever really understood why." (to WILL) What!? Yeah I did! It was cause I was strong as shit!

SKIP

More like dumb as shit.

ANDY
Screw you! (reading) "When we left the field that day becoming friends seemed like a last resort. But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other." 

(Silence)
JACK
Wow Will, that's really good.


 53
        

WILL
Thanks.

(ANDY slams the notebook shut)

ANDY

Well I hate it!

SKIP
Come on Andy! We never would have become friends if you'd run those touchdowns into the right end zone. (beat) Either time.

(The guys laugh)

ANDY
True, but it's a story, can't you change it a little? Artistic likeness?


WILL
License?

ANDY
Yeah all that. Besides where's all the shit about you?

WILL
What are you talking about?

ANDY

Why isn't there anything in here about you being a fatty.

WILL
I was not.

ANDY
Uh yes you were. You were a fucking tub! You were so fat your belly came out from under your jersey. 

(SKIP laughs hard)

WILL

Whatever man, that was baby fat!

ANDY
Dude that was not baby fat. That was fat fat. You came to school with like twenty Snack Packs a day. You looked like Chunk from The Goonies!

(They all laugh)

WILL
You guys suck!

(The boys collapse and sprawl out on the grass.)

WILL

How many kids do you think have graduated from this school?

JACK
So many.

SKIP
That's not a number, Jack.

WILL
(WILL sits up) Seriously though, how many kids have filed in and out of this building over the years, like it was a goddamn assembly line. Think about all those kids that graduated in our class that we never even knew. Like, remember that skinny kid with the thick glasses who always farted in gym?


JACK
Fahid?

WILL
Yeah him!  He'll forever be known as the kid you never wanted to follow behind during the rope climb. And that's probably all we'll ever know him as.

ANDY
He also borrowed my pen during Calculus and never gave it back. I'll never forget that. 

SKIP

(to ANDY. Sarcastically amazed) You took Calculus?

ANDY
Yup! Got a C -

WILL
(Will stands up and runs to the bleachers) I mean, how many kids do you think have sat out on these bleachers over the years? How many?(Will runs over to the bleachers and stands on the first row of seats) Who sat here? Huh? (Will runs back to the third row and stands) Who sat here? (The guys laugh. But WILL is driven.) No really! (beat) Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! (Points to where Andy is sitting)


ANDY
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." 

WILL
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who that is. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...and even then there are probably thousands of Chris' and Amanda's. 

 59
        

ANDY
I bet Amanda's hot! Just saying.

WILL
Think about all the stuff that has happened out here. And we're part of it. Cuz we're really here.

SKIP
You're insane.

WILL

No, I just have a vivid imagination. 

JACK
Hey, do you guys remember when Will told us he was 16 when he wasn't?

(Everyone explodes laughing, except for WILL of course)

SKIP
I haven't thought about that in so long. 

ANDY

Yea, why did you lie about that? You knew we were gonna find out when we got our drivers' licenses.

JACK
You had me for a while though, I totally bought the "my mom wants me to wait until she thinks I'm ready."

SKIP
Cuz your mom would so do that. That lady is crazy.

ANDY
Crazy hot! 


SKIP
Gentlemen, Andy Scott, case in point.
   
ANDY
Glad to be here, glad to be here.

JACK
I remember the day we caught you too. We were at Andy's house and your mom was like... (laughs) "It's gonna be so nice of you boys to drive Willy around for a year until he TURNS 16." WHAAAAAAAAAT? 


(Everyone laughs)

WILL
Listen jerks! Everything was going great, I didn't want the fact that we were different ages to mess anything up.
 60
        

SKIP
You're OCD. 


ANDY
It doesn't matter if our ages are symmetrical.

SKIP
Don't you mean identical?

ANDY
Yes.


JACK
You should be proud. You skipped Kindergarten! That means you're smarter than us.

SKIP
Yeah, who skips Kindergarten? Of all grades. "Oh, young William? He plays with blocks better than the other kids. Bump him!"

(They all laugh. WILL's phone rings, Goofy ring.)
SKIP

Is that really your ring?

WILL
What?

SKIP
Yikes man. 

WILL
Screw you. (answers the phone) Hello!? Patty? Hey! Hi. So did you... Really!? (disappointed) Oh.   


ANDY
What? 

WILL
(into the phone) Don't worry about it. No no it's okay. 

ANDY
What did she say?


WILL
We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Thanks anyway. (beat)  Umm... yeah I'm actually busy Thursday night too so.... Uh-huh. Yeah that's a bad night too. Remember- broken bones. I got broken bones. Okay well gotta run, but I'll talk to you later. Okay. Great! Bye. (hangs up the phone) Jesus.
 61
        

JACK
(to WILL) What's wrong?

WILL
That girl does not give up.

ANDY
No, what's up with the key!?


WILL
Well... she says it's in the building.  

ANDY
What!?

WILL
Apparently it may be in the maintenance closet. 

JACK

So what did she give us?

WILL
She doesn't know, but now she's pretty sure it's in there. 

ANDY
(sarcastic) Well that's great, we probably have his car keys. What are we supposed to do now?

SKIP

(beat) You know... we could always try and sneak into the building?

ANDY
Really?

WILL
You think?

JACK

How?

SKIP
There's that window in the gym. I used to sneak out of it during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.

ARE YOU READY REPRISE

AREN'T YOU READY FOR TONIGHT?

All right. Let's fucking do this!

WILL
SSShhhhhhhhhhhhh! Guys!

JACK

They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.

WILL
No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!

JACK
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.

WILL
Probably.


(Long silence) 

    So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?

 63
        

JACK

Sure. You can call it that. 

WILL
Sorry. (beat) So is there?

JACK
No. There isn't. 


WILL
What about... what's his face?

JACK
Who?

WILL
The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)


JACK
Kissed?

WILL
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? 

JACK
Not really. No.

WILL

Why not?

JACK
I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?

WILL
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?


JACK
You just did. Something else? 

WILL
Yea. How long have you known? 

JACK
About what? 

WILL

You know. I mean, was it something that you've always known or...
 64
        

JACK
(wryly) Why so curious?
 
WILL

I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.

JACK
    Well... I think part of me has always known... And kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.

(WILL nods, long beat)

    Does it bother you?


WILL
No, of course not. 

JACK
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?

WILL
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...


JACK
I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.

WILL
What would he have said?

JACK
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.

WILL

Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question, you know?

JACK
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.

WILL
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.

JACK

He did?? Why didn't you tell me?

WILL
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.
 65
        

JACK
What'd he say?


WILL
He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or something. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.

JACK
He said that?

WILL
...Yeah.

JACK

Should I talk to him?

WILL
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... sorry... should I not have?

JACK
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? 

WILL
It's not you, Jack. It's him.


THE THING ABOUT ANDY

WILL
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE US
 THAT'S BEEN CLEAR SINCE BACK THEN
SO THE FACT THAT HE'D CHANGE WITHOUT TELLING US WHEN   
IS NOT TOO SURPRISING
CAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR

THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE

WITH ANDY 
THE THING ABOUT ANDY
IS HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO HIM
AND HOW MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW
ANDY
THE THING ABOUT ANDY
IS WHAT HE IS HOLDING BACK

THAT HE THINKS HE CAN'T LET GO
SO HE MAY NEVER SHOW
THE THING ABOUT -
 66
        
  
JACK
MAYBE

THE THING ABOUT ANDY
IS HE DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF
THE WAY THAT HIS BEST FRIENDS DO
MAYBE
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANDY
JUST ISNT AS SMART AS US
SO HOW CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO?

WILL

OR MAYBE THAT'S NOT TRUE
AND WE DON'T KNOW ANDY

JACK
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?
HE'S STILL THE PERSON WHO
WE STOOD NEXT TO SINCE WE WERE KIDS

WILL
BUT OBVIOUSLY

THE BEST FRIEND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW
WOULD NEVER DO WHAT HE JUST DID

JACK and WILL
IT'S EMBARRASING THAT WE 
CAN LOOK SO HARD AND STILL NOT SEE

JACK
WHAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD FEEL FOR YOU...


WILL
WHEN YOU DON'T MAKE A MOVE...

JACK
WHAT FAKE FRIENDS SAY AND REAL FRIENDS DO...

WILL
IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY TO PROVE...

JACK AND WILL

THAT I NEVER REALLY KNEW
A THING ABOUT

WILL
ANDY
THE THING ABOUT ANDY
IS HE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND
THE WORK THAT A BEST FRIEND DOES

JACK

ANDY
 67
        

THE THING ABOUT ANDY
IS WHEN HE'S COMPARED TO YOU
HE'S NOT A FRIEND BECAUSE

WILL and JACK

I LOOKED AND THERE IT WAS
THE THING ABOUT -

(JACK leans in and kisses WILL. WILL pulls away.  Silence.)

WILL
What was that for?

(Silence. JACK leans in and kisses WILL again. ANDY and SKIP appear, having seen the second kiss.)

ANDY

What are you doing?

(JACK and WILL pull away from each other)

JACK
Shit. 

ANDY
Will, what are you DOING?!

(ANDY yanks WILL away from JACK)


WILL
Andy, calm down. It was nothing.

ANDY
NOTHING?! That was nothing?

SKIP
What's going on?

JACK

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -

ANDY
I don't believe this.

(ANDY grabs his jacket off the bleachers)

WILL
Andy, stop!  We need to talk about this.. 
 68

        

ANDY
(boiling.) Will. Do. You. Realize what you just did?! 

WILL
You're right! I'm sorry. But it's not what you -


ANDY
Fuck this.

(ANDY turns to exit)

WILL
Andy, come on -

JACK
(overlapping WILL)

Andy, please, can we talk for a second?

ANDY
(to Jack) You came here tonight and dropped this shit on us and assumed that everything would be fine. It's NOT fine. You lied to us -

JACK
What?


SKIP
Oh, Jesus, he didn't lie to you! 

WILL 
Guys, please just calm down -

JACK
(overlapping WILL)
No, you lied to me too, Andy. Will told me what you said.

 
WILL
Jack - 

ANDY
What?

JACK
That you couldn't deal with it. That you've been sitting here all night and you didn't want to say anything. Why not, why wouldn't you just talk to me?


ANDY
(to WILL) Why would you tell him that....

JACK
He was being a good friend, Andy. I think I have the right to know that.

ANDY
(to WILL) I don't believe you. 

 69 
        

SKIP
Why is this bothering you so much?

ANDY
I'm not having this conversation.

SKIP

Why not!? 

JACK 
I didn't tell you earlier, because I wasn't ready yet, Andy-

ANDY
Look, do whatever you want. I'm going.

(ANDY starts to exit)

SKIP
Why? What the fuck is your deal right now?

WILL
Everybody STOP IT! (to ANDY) You're right! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look its over. Just stay and we'll figure it out.(ANDY starts to leave) Andy, don't!(grabbing him) 


FORGET ABOUT IT
    
WILL 
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
DIDN'T YOU HAVE DREAMS THAT YOU LET GO OF
    CAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD YOU 
THAT YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DREAM THE WAY YOU DO

DIDN'T YOU?
 
ANDY
I USED TO.

(ANDY turns to exit)

WILL
HEY!
WE'RE STILL HERE

UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS
AND ITS CLEAR THIS IS NOT HOW WE USUALLY ARE
BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA RELEARN HOW TO FIT 
SO NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE THINKING OVER THERE
PLEASE JUST
FORGET ABOUT IT

SKIP
HOW BOUT YOU STAY TO TELL US

WHY ALL NIGHT YOU'VE BEEN BEING SUCH A PRICK
 70
        

JACK
Skip... 

SKIP
COME ON JACK, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE

 WHAT DID WE DO?

JACK
NO, WHAT DID I DO

ANDY
NOTHING, NOTHING YOU'RE PERFECT IT'S FINE
I'M THE ONE WHO'S OBVIOUSLY OUT OF LINE

SKIP

I AGREE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT YOU DO

ANDY
WELL THAT'S PRETTY DAMN SMART OF YOU

SKIP
Who the fuck do you think you -

JACK
STOP! THIS IS MY FAULT

AND I'M SORRY
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE SAID OR DONE A THING

SKIP
What?!

JACK
IF I HAD KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT THIS EVENING
 NO ONE WOULD BE OUT HERE ARGUING


SKIP
Come on -
DON'T APOLOGIZE TO HIM

ANDY
YEA DON'T APOLOGIZE TO ME 

WILL
THEN DON'T GO

PLEASE DON'T GO
NOTHING'S COLLAPSED
 JUST A MOMENTARY LAPSE
STAY PLEASE
CAUSE YOU KNOW
WE CAN FIX THIS IF YOU DO
 71
        

ANDY
YOU THINK I'D STAY FOR YOU? 

SKIP
LET HIM GO

WILL
NO LET THIS GO
(to SKIP) FORGET ABOUT IT

WHEN YOU SEE ALL THE INCONSISTENCIES
IN THE WAY WE SEE THE WORLD
(to ANDY) FORGET ABOUT IT
WHEN YOU LEARN SOMEONE YEARNS TO BE DIFFERENT
THINGS CAN CHANGE

ANDY
AS LONG AS WE DON'T FIGHT 


WILL
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT
AND MOVE ON
ALL RIGHT?

JACK

OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
    
JACK
(to ANDY)
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
YOU NEVER DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS

THAT NO ONE NEEDS TO LEARN
CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE

BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR
CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE
WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL

SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL

(ANDY starts to walk away)

SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
DO NOT ACCEPT 
 WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND

SO, AS ONE OF THEM
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...

ANDY
(overlapping)
...LOOK WHO'S "SPEAKING OUT"
LIKE HE KNOWS ABOUT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS

THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
DON'T FUCK WITH EACH OTHER

    
     
(Silence.)
    
JACK
And now you have nothing to say? (beat) All right. I guess I'll leave.


WILL
Jack- 

JACK
No. It's okay.

(JACK exits)

SKIP
(to ANDY) What the FUCK is your problem?


ANDY
What!?

SKIP
How could you say that to him?

ANDY
I wasn't calling him that!

SKIP

Honestly, where is the disconnect in your fucking brain man! He's supposed to be one of your best friends and you treat him like he wronged you. He did nothing to you.

ANDY
Skip -

SKIP
You just fucked up a friendship for all of us because you're too selfish to get that it's not always about YOU!

ANDY
Can I say something?

74
        

SKIP
No! Everything that's coming out of your mouth tonight is toxic, and I'm tired of listening to it. There's no excuse for what you said.

WILL
Andy, he's right.

ANDY

Yeah you're one to talk! You've fucked this thing up more than anyone else. I trusted you - 

SKIP
There you go Andy, it's always someone else. It's never about YOU, is it??

ANDY
That's not true -

SKIP
ANDY

    THE THING ABOUT ANDY
IS YOU'RE NOT THE VICTIM
YOU ARE THE PROBLEM

WILL
ANDY
    THE THING IS THAT, ANDY
THESE PROBLEMS AREN'T FINISHED

SO WHY DON'T YOU SOLVE THEM? 

(ANDY turns around.)

ANDY

YOU TOLD ME TO SHUT MY MOUTH
YOU TOLD ME TO BE POLITE

WELL I KNOW I SHOULD AND IF I DID I WOULD
BUT I DONT FEEL THAT WAY TONIGHT

IM JUST ANGRY AT THE FACT - 
NO IT'S MORE LIKE SAD
THAT MY THREE BEST FRIENDS WHO TURNED ON ME
WERE THE ONLY FAMILY I HAD

WHEN IVE BEEN TRYING
    TO FIT IN AND BE WHAT YOU WANTED ME TO BE

    TRYING TO BE LIKE YOU
    BUT I GUESS YOU CANT CHANGE...

SKIP
ANDY
    THE THING ABOUT ANDY
 75

        

ANDY

SO SHUT THE FUCK UP
WHY ANDY?
IT'S ALL ABOUT "ANDY"
BUT NOBODY LETS ME SPEAK!

NOW IT'S MY TURN

TO SAY WHAT YOU'D NEVER LET ME SAY
I KNOW I DONT TALK THE WAY YOU DO
BUT I CAN DO IT MY WAY

IT IS MY TURN
TO BE HONEST EVEN IF IM NOT RIGHT
CUZ LISTENING TO YOU PROVES

AND IT IS MY TURN


SKIP
BEFORE YOU GO YOU SHOULD KNOW...


SKIP and WILL
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.....

ANDY
INCLUDES ME TOO YOU GUYS
YOU CANT JUST ERASE ME

IM SORRY JACK HAD TO TURN HIS BACKT
BUT THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS FACE ME

YOU CAN'T KEEP LYING TO YOURSELF
AND HOPE YOU'LL FORGET IT
LYING TO KEEP US CLOSE
BUT IT WENT TO SHIT CUZ YOU LET IT

SO, FUCK YOU AND YOUR PRECIOUS LIES
I LIED FOR YOU WITHOUT THINKING TWICE

YOU DONT WANT US TO GROW UP
    BUT NO MATTER WHAT YOU TRY
    
    THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WILL
        LOOK AROUND
        YOUR GOOD OLD GLORY DAYS
        ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND 

    
    (ANDY picks up the notebook up off the bleachers)
    
    AND ALL OF THESE MEMORIES WE USED TO ENJOY
        THE NIGHTS OUT HERE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE
        THE BROTHERS THAT NO ONE COULD EVER DESTROY
        WERE WORTH NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING!!


 76
        

    (ANDY tears the notebook apart and drops the pieces to the grass.)

WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOYS?

NOW IT'S MY TURN TO ASK YOU 
    WHEN I CANT TRUST YOU WHAT DO I DO

    WHEN WE'VE BEEN BEST FRIENDS FOR SO LONG
    AND THATS NO LONGER TRUE?

YEA IT'S MY TURN TO GO
BUT IT'S YOUR TURN TO KNOW
THAT I MAY BE WRONG
AND NO I DON'T BELONG HERE
BUT IT WAS YOU WHO MADE IT SO

    
    I'm going home.
    
    (ANDY exits.)

    SKIP
        Andy -

    
(WILL, near tears, is on the ground, trying to piece together his journal)

What was he talking about? You lied to him?

WILL
No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.

SKIP

About what?

WILL
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything about it, cause I didn't want him to fuck anything up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.

SKIP
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing?  Something you wanna tell me?


WILL
No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.

SKIP
You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.

WILL
I know.

(WILL continues to pick up the pieces of the notebook)


SKIP
(beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.

(SKIP kneels down to help)

WILL
(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. 


SKIP
Well, that's not healthy.

WILL
Yeah, maybe not. 

SKIP
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.


WILL
I know, but when the hell did that happen?

SKIP
Good question.

BOYS

WILL
WHEN WE WERE BOYS

WE HAD FUN
AND BLAMED MISTAKES ON BEING HUMAN

BUT NOW WE'RE OLD
AND EVEN ONE
WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN

YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND


ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID
ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT HE AND I DID
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER WE WERE SO SURE
THAT WE'D NEVER STOP BEING BOYS ANYMORE

SKIP
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU THINK IS DEAD
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE YOUR LIFE IS OVER
 78

        

WILL
IT FEELS THAT WAY

SKIP
BUT NO ONE SAID
WE CANT SCREW UP WHEN WE GET OLDER

WILL

WE WERE SO PERFECT TIL TODAY

SKIP
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT
THE GOOD OLD DAYS

WILL and SKIP
NEVER STAY

ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID

MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE
BUT DOES THAT MEAN WE CANT BE BOYS ANYMORE?

WILL
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING
  
THAT I COULD BE LOSING YOU

SKIP

NOBODY IS LOSING
EVERYONE'S JUST GROWING TOO

WILL
WHAT IF THIS WAS NEVER RIGHT
AND IT TOOK US UP UNTIL TONIGHT 
TO REALIZE WE'D BEEN SAVING FACE
AND ADMIT WE ARE OUT OF PLACE

SKIP

IT DOESN'T MEAN WE WERE WRONG
JUST CAUSE WE DIDN'T GET ALONG
FOR ONE DAY
ONE DAY

WILL and SKIP
ONE DAY

WILL
I AM NOT READY TO STOP BEING A KID


SKIP
WELL NOBODY SAID THAT WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED
 79
        

WILL and SKIP
WE'LL NEVER BE WHO WE WERE BEFORE

SKIP

BUT NEVER SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BOYS...

WILL and SKIP
(tradeoff)
ANYMORE
ANYMORE
ANYMORE

(A long silence)


SKIP
God I hate this place. Why couldn't we have gone to Andy's and watched Ella Enchanted? (beat) I'm gonna go.  You want a ride?

WILL
No, that's okay.

SKIP

You sure?

WILL
Yeah...I think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.

SKIP
All right. We're gonna be okay. I promise.

(SKIP starts to exit.)

Oh I almost forgot.


(SKIP pulls a key out of his pocket and tosses it to WILL)

WILL
You found it.

SKIP
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. 

WILL

(smiles) Thanks.

(Silence)

SKIP
(beat) Hey. I love you, ok?
 80

        

WILL
I know. I love you too.

SKIP
(beat) Night buddy.

WILL 

    Night man.

(SKIP exits.)

MY NEXT STORY

LOOK AT THIS FIELD
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?

THESE WHITE LINES?
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE
EXCEPT FOR MINE

IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY 
INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO

OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME

IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY

THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW
AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW 
THEM BACK TOGETHER

I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE

BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER

I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT
WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR 
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT 
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE 

BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY

 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME
 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY

LETS SEE
IM MAKING MISTAKES

BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION
IM GETTING LOST
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION
 81
        

WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?
WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?
AND WHEN AM I MAN?

AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN

WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE 
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...
REMEMBER...
ALWAYS REMEMBER...
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...


(throws the key into the distance)

I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY
AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY
CAUSE IT'S JUST ME

AND MY NEXT STORY

(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)

THE END.

GLORY DAYS
