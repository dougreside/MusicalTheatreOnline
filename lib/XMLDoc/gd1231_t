GLORY DAYS
A New Musical
Music and Lyrics by Nick Blaemire 
Book by James Gardiner


(A night in May. A high school football field. WILLIAM LEVINSON, 18, enters wearing a backpack and carrying a small notebook. He walks out to the center of the field)

MY THREE BEST FRIENDS
WILL
LOOK AT THIS FIELD
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS HERE
JUST WHITE LINES

NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE
EXCEPT FOR TIME
AND SO MUCH HISTORY
IMAGINE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE
ALL THE STORIES
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN WON
AND FRIENDS HAVING FUN
COMING BACK FOR ONE PERFECT NIGHT
RIGHT HERE 


(WILL sets his backpack down on the player's bench. He opens his notebook and begins to read)

THIS IS THE STORY OF FOUR BEST FRIENDS
WHEN WE'RE IN ONE PLACE THE NIGHT NEVER ENDS
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER, AND THEN
IN THE SAME BREATH ACT LIKE WE'RE TEN
AND THEN DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN

WE'RE FROM - JUST IMAGINE THIS KIND OF TOWN

WHERE THE POPULAR CLIQUE KEEPS YOU DOWN
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ON PADS AND MAKE CAVEMAN SOUNDS
AS YOU KNOCK SMALLER KIDS THAN YOU TO THE GROUND
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN TO BE AROUND?

WE WERE NEVER BIG ENOUGH OR FAST ENOUGH
TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THEM
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS SMART ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH 
TO KNOW WE'D BE BETTER IN THE END

THAN THE SENIORS FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM
WHO WOULDN'T LET US PLAY
WE COULDN'T CATCH OR RUN AS FAST
 
Page 1
    SO THEY TOLD US WE WERE GAY
THEY TRIED TO MAKE US WORSHIP THEM
BUT WE LIKED THINGS OUR WAY

JUST ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS

(WILL begins flipping through the pages of his notebook)

SKIP IS THE CYNIC AND JACK'S THE VOICE OF REASON
AND ANDY'S THE REASON THAT SKIP IS A CYNIC
WE'RE BICKERING BROTHERS, IT'S SICK
IT'S LIKE IF OIL AND WATER COULD MIX
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT US THAT JUST CLICKS


CUZ I AM THE GLUE THAT HOLDS US TOGETHER
OBSERVER, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE 
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS REMEMBER
WHERE WE STARTED FROM, AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME
SINCE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD NO ONE
BUT WHEN WE FORMED THIS PERFECT UNION
A NEW ERA HAD BEGUN
WE GET THIS LIFE SO DIFFERENTLY

THEN ANYONE OUR AGE CHOOSES TO SEE
ME AND MY THREE BEST FRIENDS

   (WILL begins to write) 

 YOUR BEST FRIENDS OPEN UP YOUR MIND
TO PARTS OF YOU YOU COULDN'T FIND
THEY SAVED MY LIFE FRESHMAN YEAR

AND I THANK THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE

WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR WAY TOO LONG
AND ALL THAT TIME ALONE FELT WRONG
CAUSE WE BELONG RIGHT HERE

BUT WE'RE COMING BACK TONIGHT
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE LIKE
AND PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LET GO
ALMOST A YEAR AGO

 

I KNOW THIS STORY SO WELL
AND IT IS MINE TO TELL
BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING...TO ME
YEA ME AND MY THREE 
ME AND MY THREE
ME AND MY THREE
BEST FRIENDS

    (SKIP THOMAS, 19, enters without WILL noticing.)
    
 SKIP
Who're you talking to...? 

WILL

(startled) Skip!! Heyyy!! 

(WILL slams his notebook shut and tosses it under the bench) 

SKIP
(imitating) Heyyy buddy!!


WILL
It's so good to see you.

(WILL hugs SKIP)

SKIP
You too. (beat) Where are the other fools? I thought you said midnight.

WILL

(exasperated) I know... I probably should have told them 9. (beat) What's up with your hair? 

SKIP
You like? I'm just letting nature do its thing. 

WILL

(amused) You look like a girl.

SKIP
Oh, you wanna start already? Cause we can go Tubs Tubs!

(SKIP playfully slaps WILL's stomach) 
   


    SKIP
    Wanna go? Let's go! Who's a girl now? Huh? Who's a girl now Tub Tubs? Wanna cry? 		

    WILL
        I'm joking! No. Okay, okay! No, no, no. I'm sorry. Cut it out.

    
    
WILL

HEY, look, if you don't stop I'm not gonna tell you what we're doing tonight! 

SKIP
(stops) What we're doing? I thought this was it.

WILL
Nope. I've got a plan. Tell me -

    Page 3 

ARE YOU READY

WILL
ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT? 


SKIP
What? 

WILL

ARE YOU READY TO MAKE HISTORY? 
RIGHT HERE ON THIS FOOTBALL FIELD 
YOU AND ME 
AND TWO OTHER GUYS 
WHO COULD SHOW UP AT ANY TIME 
WHEN EVER THEY DO GET HERE, I'M

HOPING YOU'RE READY 

SKIP
What are we doing?  

WILL
I can't tell you that. 

SKIP

Why not? 

WILL
(coyly) Cause... I don't know if I trust you.

SKIP
Just tell me!

WILL

Not yet!
WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT
WE ALL WILL BE HERE FINALLY
AND WHEN WE ARE, YOU'LL FINALLY SEE
"WHAT THIS HIGH SCHOOL MEANS TO ME" 

SKIP
HOW 'BOUT A HINT?


WILL
HOW 'BOUT WE WAIT FOR ALL THE GUYS

SKIP
I'LL ACT LIKE I'M STILL SURPRISED!

    Page 4
    WILL
FINE. DO YOU LIKE WATER RIDES?


SKIP
Are we going to Sea World? 

WILL
Yup.

SKIP
Really?!


WILL
Nope. But close.

SKIP
 I hate you. (beat) Is it something -?  
       

WILL 
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GUESS
YOU WONT BE ABLE TO
CAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS GONNA DUMBFOUND EVEN YOU

(ANDY SCOTT, 19, and JACK MOYER, 19, enter bickering.) 

ANDY

Oh pleeease dude, Batman is so much cooler. He's got all those gadgets and shit-

JACK
So!? Superman could pick up an entire planet and drop it on Batman.

ANDY
Yeah, but can he stop a Batarang?

JACK
 He can travel at the speed of light, Andy. You don't think he can get away from a Batarang?  


ANDY
Will, help me out here. Batman verse Superman. Who wins?

WILL
Superman.

ANDY
(to WILL) Fuck that!


WILL
Jaaaack!
    
    Page 5
JACK
Wiiill! What's up Holmes!?
    
    WILL

        What's up Skillet!?
    
ANDY
(sees SKIP) Hey, who's the hippie?

SKIP
Yeah, nice to see you too.


(ANDY hugs SKIP. Without missing a beat, ANDY tries to get SKIP's opinion on the whole Batman vs. Superman debate.)  

WILL 
(to JACK) ARE YOU READY FOR TONIGHT? 

JACK
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BACK OUT HERE?


WILL
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST YEAR!

JACK
(looking around)I GOTTA SAY IT'S PRETTY WEIRD 

WILL
HOW WAS LIFE AT SCHOOL?


JACK
PROBABLY THE SAME AS YOU

WILL 
THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S TRUE UNLESS YOU ROOMED WITH ANDY TOO.

SKIP
(to ANDY) Drop it - 


ANDY
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU THINK THAT BATMAN
WOULD LOSE A BATTLE TO A GUY IN TIGHTS? 
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE GAY RED UNDIES 
HE WEARS OUTSIDE OF HIS PANTS? 

SKIP
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU'D EVER BEGIN 

TO ARGUE WITH ME, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'LL NEVER WIN
    
    Page 6
BATMAN IS HUMAN AND SUPERMAN'S NOT 
SO WHO'S GONNA DIE IF ONE OF THEM GETS SHOT? 

ANDY
What's your point?


WILL
Sooo... ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT? 

SKIP
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? 

WILL
HAVE I EVER STEERED YOU WRONG? 


SKIP
I DUNNO. IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

WILL
JUST GET READY FOR TONIGHT
AND WHAT A NIGHT IT'S GONNA BE
YOU AND YOU AND YOU AND ME

ALL

FINALLY...

WILL
BACK TOGETHER 

JACK
I'VE MISSED YOU GUYS 

ANDY (to JACK)

YOU ONLY LIKE SUPERMAN CAUSE HE FLIES

WILLNOW ARE YOU READY FOR  

ALL GUYS
READY 
FOR TONIGHT  
RIGHT 
HERE!!


WILL
What took you guys so long?
    
    Page 7
JACK
Ask slobbers over here, I was waiting outside his house for like 10 minutes!

ANDY

I said I was sorry!  I'm sorry! 

(WILL runs over to his backpack)

SKIP
Slobbers? What was he doing?

JACK
He was passed out in the living room watching Ella Enchanted. 


ANDY
I was not! 

JACK
Slobbering all over the sofa. 

ANDY
Whatever man! My sister was watching it. 

SKIP

Oh yeaaah, how's she doing? 

(JACK laughs)
ANDY
    
(to SKIP) 
Don't start -

SKIP
What!? I'm genuinely interested!


ANDY
(suspicious) She's fine. 
    
SKIP
That's good. (beat) Does she still ask about me? 


ANDY
I'm gonna punch you in the face - 

SKIP
Hey now, there's no need to get all huffy...it's not my fault your sister's bangin'! 

    ANDY
She's twelve years old!  


JACK
Hey, whatever floats your boat, right? 
    
    Page 8
ANDY
(to JACK)My sister is not allowed to float anyone's boat!  


JACK
Aww, you're no fun. 

SKIP
But your sister is! 

SKIP and JACK
OHHHHHHH!!(raspberry) 


(SKIP and JACK slap high five) 

ANDY
(grabbing at SKIP and JACK)Come here! 
    
(ANDY chases SKIP and JACK around the field) 

SKIP

What? Take it as a compliment. You've got good genes!

ANDY
I swear to God-

WILL
All right guys! Come on! Hey! HEY!  
    
(WILL throws his arms around ANDY to hold him back. Andy continues to struggle) 


(to ANDY)Chill! Look, we've got important business to take care of - 

    (ANDY stops struggling and WILL releases him.)
    
ANDY
I got you later!  

SKIP

Oh yeah?

ANDY
Yeah, I do!

WILL
 (scolding) Okay, enough! Here. Read.


(WILL hands ANDY a newspaper clipping)

    Page 9
ANDY
What is this?

JACK
(sarcastic) A piece of paper.


ANDY
I can see that! (to WILL) What's it for?

WILL
Just read!

(ANDY takes a look at the paper. Clears his throat and reads)


ANDY
(reading) "Come one, come all to the First Annual Fighting Beavers Annual Alumni Football Game." What!? The FIGHTING Beavers? When did they change that shit! 

WILL
Apparently they didn't think the beaver was intimidating enough on its own.

ANDY
But that makes no sense. Beavers aren't violent. They're gentle woodland creatures.


WILL
Keep reading!

ANDY
Okay! (reading) "On Saturday May 20th watch our very own Fighting Beavers" ... (aside)mmmGAY! ... "take on the Varsity Alumni in what promises to be a real treat. All Alumni are invited to attend." 

SKIP

Wow, you read that really well!

ANDY
Shut up! (to WILL) What the hell is this?

WILL
This,my friend, is inspiration.


    (WILL takes the paper from ANDY and walks back towards the player's bench) 

ANDY
What?
    
    Page 10
SKIP

Oh Jesus.... (i.e. "here we go again...")

(WILL steps up on the player's bench as if it were his own personal soapbox)

WILL
Do you guys realize what this means? Tomorrow afternoon. Right here. We're gonna have... (pointing to Andy) can I get a drum roll please.
    
    ANDY

        Ah, hell yeah! (ANDY begins drum roll)
    
    WILL
Matt Hoffman, Chris Peterson, Eric Spencer, Danny Barwick - 

JACK
No shit!? 


WILL
Yes shit! The whole lot of em. And at exactly 1:30, while they're lining up for the opening kick, they're going to witness... no scratch that... EXPERIENCE a miracle.
    
    JACK
        Jesus?

    
    WILL
        No. Better. You see that box?
    
(WILL points to a small weather box situated near the players bench)
    
    ANDY

Yup.

JACK
Yeah.

WILL
Skip?

SKIP
Uh-huh. Box. Got it.


WILL
That box contains something truly magical. Inside that box is the timer to the school's brand new... state of the art... sprinkler system. (reaches into his pocket and pulls out a key) And this, my friends, is the key. 

(WILL tosses the key to ANDY)
    
    Page 11

ANDY
(gets it) Fucking genius!

JACK 
 I don't get it.

ANDY
(amazed. To WILL) We're gonna soak the bastards!


JACK
 Why?
    
    ANDY
        Cause it's funny as shit!
        
WILL

Let's just call it retribution. This is for every time we were made fun of. For every time we were walked over or treated like shit. This is karma at its finest boys! 

ANDY
Blown! My mind is officially blown. 

(SKIP takes the key from ANDY) 

WILL
We've waited for this moment for five years and tomorrow it's on. All we have to do is reset the timer.


ANDY
(extends his hand to WILL) Well done sir! 

WILL
(shakes ANDY's hand) Ah thank you!

ANDY
I take back every time I ever called you queer. (beat) For the next five minutes.


SKIP
How did you get this?

WILL
I have my sources.

JACK
Who?

WILL

I know people. 

SKIP
No you don't.
    
    Page 12
JACK
Are you gonna tell us who or not?


WILL
(a strained, pregnant beat) Patricia Wedntz.

ANDY
FAT PAT!?

SKIP
Who?


WILL
(to SKIP, referencing ANDY) Exactly why I didn't want to tell you!

ANDY
You don't remember PAT!? Sophomore, redhead? She's the janitor's niece. Kinda ... thick?

WILL
Andy - 


ANDY
What!?

WILL
Don't call her thick!

ANDY
I'm creating a visual. 

JACK

You did call her Fat Pat.

SKIP
(to WILL) Wait, is this the girl who asked you to homecoming, but you said no for religious reasons? 

ANDY
That's the one!

JACK

Oh, HER! (beat) Wow.

SKIP
Why'd she give it to you?

WILL
(a slight hesitation) Cause she was being nice.

    
    Page 13
ANDY
(joking) Yeah right! What'd you do, take her out on a date?

WILL
(caught off guard) No, it wasn't a - (stops mid sentence. Catches himself)


ANDY
What?

WILL
Huh?

ANDY
It wasn't a what?


WILL
What?

ANDY
 Oh sweet Lord Jesus NO! (beat) You DID!

WILL

No I - No. (pause) It wasn't a date.

ANDY
(hardly controlling himself) Then what was it?

WILL
We just went out to eat.


ANDY
To EAT!? That's an operation. Where'd you take her, Cracker Barrel? No wait! No no wait I got it - it's coming to me - where would you take her so no one would see you AND your jew ass could feed her for cheap.... Denny's!

(WILL remains silent.)

ANDY
(laughing hysterically) Yes!!! I knew it! What'd she get? I have to know. 


WILL
Andy, really?

ANDY
A steak, or three? Some cheeseburgers? Maybe a nice little Chocolate Brownie Fudge Delight with some extra fixins?

JACK
Sprinkles!
    
    Page 14

ANDY
Oh, You KNOW that girl can throw down! We're talking marshmallows, butter scotch, peanuts, candy corn, pop corn... maybe some real corn -

JACK
Ewww.

ANDY
Hot fudge, a couple bananas for potassium -

WILL

 You're a real jerk, you know that? 

ANDY
Ah come on man. I'm just playing! Look, I'm seriously proud of you! She's a catch.

WILL
She's not a catch and you know it!

ANDY
Why?


WILL
Cause she's...

ANDY
...Fat? That's fucked up Will.

(JACK laughs at this)
WILL
 I didn't say that. You're the one calling her fat!


ANDY
All I'm saying is she's a sure thing. (putting his arm around WILL) And Will, buddy, you need to start taking advantage of these opportunities. Cause let's be honest, you didn't really get any this year.

WILL
(pushing ANDY away) Just cuz I didn't want any of the diseased skanks that you and your frat brothers hooked up with doesn't mean I didn't get any.

ANDY

What are you talking about? Those girls were prime real estate!

SKIP
Woah, woah, woah. I'm sorry. You joined a frat? 

ANDY
(proudly) Hells yeah manio! Delta Kai Epsilon! Deke Men - Class of 2010 baby!
    
    Page 15

SKIP
Oh God.

WILL
I know. Of all things. (points to ANDY) HUGE hypocrite!

ANDY
ME? WHY!?


WILL
Cause it goes against everything we stand for.

SKIP
And it's just lame.

ANDY
You're lame!

JACK

Isn't that kinda like buying your friends? 

ANDY
(offended) No! It's about a brotherhood.  A fellowship! A bond! 

WILL
That you pay for.

ANDY

Whatever man, all I know is I was getting some high quality poon this year while you were sitting alone in your room jerkin the gherkin! 

WILL
I was not.

ANDY
Oh really? Why don't you tell Jack and Skip how many girls you boofed?

WILL
They don't care.


SKIP
I'm kind of interested.

ANDY
Well I'll tell you! The answer is zero. None! Nada! He couldn't get a single girl to touch his little Jewish ding-a-ling.

WILL
That's not true. 
    

    Page 16
ANDY
Uh, okay, then. How many?

WILL
I don't know... like... probably... 15.

SKIP
(amazed) Really?


WILL
Yeah really... maybe even 20.

    
    
    JACK
    Wow man, good for you!

    SKIP
        Yeah, I never would have thought -
    

    
    
ANDY
Bullshit!! (to SKIP and JACK) He's lying!

WILL
I am not!

ANDY
(to SKIP and JACK) I've been with him the whole year. He hasn't even talked to 15 girls.


WILL
You don't have to talk to 'em when you're doing it.

SKIP
He's got a point! 

ANDY
You're so full of shit.

WILL

Don't be hurt.

ANDY
I'm not!

WE'VE GOT GIRLS
ANDY
D'YOU EVER WONDER WHERE THE FEMALES GO
WHEN THERE'S NO ONE AT THE BAR AND IT'S LONELY ON THE DANCE FLOOR
TOO BAD FOR YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE HERE WITH ME

WAITING IN LINE UNTIL WE MAMBO HORIZONTALLY
    
WILL
D'YOU EVER WONDER WHERE HE GETS THIS SHIT
    
    Page 17
OR IF ANY OF THE SKANKS THAT HE BANGS BELIEVE A WORD OF IT?
HE ISN'T ANYBODY'S MR. RIGHT

I'M THE ONE THE LADIES WANT FOR MORE THAN JUST A NIGHT

ANDY
    DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD HE SAYS
HE HASN'T BEEN KISSED SINCE TRUTH OR DARE

WILL
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE
WHEN IM WITH GIRLS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE THERE

I SAY WHAT THEY WANNA HEAR
AND YOU DON'T KNOW CUZ YOU DON'T CARE

ANDY

WILL
IVE FIGURED EM OUT AND GOT EM UP AGAINST THE WALL


ANDY

YOU'RE MAKING THIS UP!
YOU'D HAVE TO HIDE IN A WOMEN'S BATHROOM STALL
TO GET A GIRL NEAR YOUR BALLS

(ANDY laughs)

ANDY

Don't lie Will, it makes you look bad.

WILL
Hey, I'm not saying I'm the best looking guy around. I never used to get any, but things change, Andy. Things change. 

WILL
IN HIGH SCHOOL, GIRLS WERE OUT OF MY LEAGUE AND I KNEW IT

JACK
I'm glad you knew it!


WILL
ONE AWKWARD GLANCE OR THEY'D SEE ME DANCE AND I BLEW IT

SKIP
What about Fat Pat?
    
    Page 18
WILL

ANDY AND WILL
YOU ARE THE OPPOSITE OF ME
IM MORE THAN HAPPY TO AGREE

SKIP
    Jesus, you guys are like a  pair of twelve year olds. You haven't changed at all.


ANDY
You're right, Will's still a lying sack of shit!

WILL
At least I have a sack! Pussy. 

SKIP
Knock it off!

JACK

Come on! Don't you two want nice, sane things? Like love?

(ANDY "poontang's" throughout)
OF COURSE WE WANT TO BE IN LOVE
AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR ROMANCE
BUT TIL WE FIND THAT LONESOME DOVE

ANDY AND WILL

ANDY

ANDY

YEAAAAAAAAAAAA!

JACK
Well, I'm glad to see you guys have grown up.

ANDY
Oh things have grown.... (smiles) 

SKIP

You're an idiot.
  
JACK
I can't believe you two lived in the same room for a whole year.

WILL
It was hard, he never showers.

ANDY
Shut up dude!


WILL
Maybe once a week.

ANDY
Whatever, I was a great roommate.

JACK
I wouldn't want to live with you. 


ANDY
Why!? (puts his hand on JACK) We could be bunk buddies! (JACK shrugs him off)
    
    Page 21
    
WILL

Can you imagine if the four of us had lived together? I mean if we had all gone to the same school.

ANDY
That would've been tight! The four of us in a suite, trading bitches like Pokemon cards!

JACK
Sorry for ruining your dream.

WILL
I mean, just think of all the stuff we could've pulled on a college campus. 


SKIP
You mean stupid pranks like this one?

WILL
What are you talking about? This is going to be epic! We're going to go down in history for this.

SKIP
With who? No one's even gonna know we did it!

WILL

Um, we'll know.

ANDY
(to SKIP) What is your problem, Debbie Downer?

SKIP
Excuse me?

ANDY

You. Anytime there's any risk involved you turn into little miss Negative Nancy!

SKIP
No I don't! 

    WILL
        Yes you do!

ANDY

Seriously, I thought you were gonna wet yourself that time we took out your Dad's Jeep.

SKIP
That was my idea!

ANDY
Yeah, but you were sweatin' beads the whole time. "I dunno guys, maybe we should abort..."

WILL
Andy -	

    
    Page 22
JACK
To be fair, his dad is pretty frightening.

ANDY
Yea, but who says abort?

SKIP

My dad's in the military, jackass!

ANDY
Yeah, but you're not! Nobody said you had to speak like a douchebag!

WILL
Andy, will you shut up for a second! 

ARE YOU READY REPRISE
WILL

ARE WE READY FOR TONIGHT?

SKIP
AREN'T WE ALREADY HERE?

ANDY
DID ANYBODY GET THE BEER?

WILL
WE'LL DRINK IT WHEN WE'RE IN THE CLEAR

SO GET READY FOR TONIGHT
AND WHAT A NIGHT ITS GONNA BE
YOU AND YOU AND YOU AND ME

(The boys move over to the box)

 ALL
FINALLY...

(WILL turns the key, but -)


WILL
Shit! 

ANDY
What? 

WILL
It won't open.
    

    Page 23
ANDY
Yes it will.

WILL
No, actually, it won't.

ANDY
Get outta the way! You don't know how to turn a friggin key.


(ANDY pushes WILL out of the way)

Here. See you gotta turn it to the left you dil-

(ANDY tries to turn the key, but the lock won't budge)

You gotta turn it - to the -

(ANDY tries again, but the lock still won't budge)
    

You gotta - 

WILL
Yes? 
    
    ANDY
        (to the key) Fuck you! 

    
    WILL
        See? 
    
JACK
What's wrong?

ANDY

(to WILL) You got the wrong key! 

WILL
I got the wrong key!? This is what she gave me. 

ANDY
God damn it FAT PAT! 

WILL

Andy -

ANDY
You got scammed by a plus sized hooker! 

WILL
She probably just got em mixed up.
    
    Page 25

JACK
Can you call her?

WILL
What? No!

ANDY
Why not?

WILL

You call her!

ANDY
Why the hell would I call her? She's your girlfriend!

WILL
She is not, shut up!

ANDY
Look, stop being a pussy. (ANDY takes out his phone) If she got em mixed up then she can bring over the right one-


(ANDY tosses his phone to WILL)

WILL
No, its gonna give her the wrong idea.

(WILL tosses the phone back to ANDY)

ANDY
Just tell her to put down the pork chops and get over here-


(ANDY tosses the phone to WILL)

WILL
I'm not doing it!

(WILL tosses the phone back to ANDY)

ANDY
Well I guess we can't do the prank then.

(ANDY tosses the phone to WILL)


WILL
Andy! 

(WILL tosses the phone to ANDY. SKIP catches it)
    
    Page 25A
SKIP
Jesus, you morons, who cares!?


WILL
What do you mean who cares? 

ANDY
What are we supposed to do now?

SKIP
Why don't we try hanging out for a change? You ever think of that?

ANDY

We are.

SKIP
No, this is not hanging out. You guys wanna play Inspector Gadget or whatever, but I'd rather just sit here and drink some beers. Why do we have to DO something to make the night memorable? I haven't seen you guys in almost a year. We're finally together in the same place. Isn't that enough? 

WILL
(beat) Sorry.


SKIP
Think about it. We don't have to associate ourselves with this place ever again, so why do you wanna come back and pull some stupid prank? We're past that.

WILL
It's not stupid! 

SKIP
(looking for support) Jack?


JACK
(to WILL) I'm with him on this one, sorry.

WILL
Guys! Andy? Help me out here.

ANDY
I mean, yeah, I still think it'd be funny as shit. 


WILL
And it sends a message. (the boys are unconvinced) It does!

SKIP
What message is that?
    
    Page 26

WILL
That we deserve respect.

SKIP
From who?

WILL
From them!

SKIP

Oh that makes a ton of sense. (beat) Will. You really think they're gonna start respecting us for setting off sprinklers during their little charity football game?

WILL
It's not about that - it's.... (beat) Come on, don't you think they deserve it!

JACK
Will it was five years ago!


WILL
So!? It still happened! And all because we didn't make their precious little team -

SKIP
Here we go. 

WILL
They're the reason that we're friends. So why not, you know, celebrate that by giving them the fuck you that they deserve?

SKIP

But Will, they're not gonna care. They never did, so why would they start now?

WILL
Then maybe, it's not about them! Maybe it's about us!

RIGHT HERE 

WILL
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
DIDN'T YOU HAVE DREAMS THAT YOU LET GO OF

CUZ SOMEBODY TOLD YOU THAT YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DREAM
THE WAY YOU DO
JUST CUZ YOU WERE DIFFERENT

LIKE
WHEN I WAS 12 
I BOUGHT MYSELF SOME LA LIGHTS
REMEMBER, THOSE SHOES THAT YOU COULD SEE AT NIGHT
    

    Page 27
    CUZ BRIAN NOONAN RULED AND HE WORE THEM TO SCHOOL 
AND I HATED HIM
BUT I WANTED TO BE COOL 
ANDY
OR 
IN 7TH GRADE
I STARTED SAYING "CHILLIN BRO"

EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T COLD
CAUSE ERIC SPENCER SAID THEY ALL KNEW WHAT IT MEANT
AND IF I DIDN'T 
I'D LOOK LIKE A TOOL

WILL
THAT'S WHAT I USED TO THINK
RIGHT WHEN I WAS ON THE BRINK
OF BEING JUST ANOTHER KINK IN THEIR SOCIAL REGIME

BUT MY LIFE GOT TURNED AROUND 
WHEN I FOUND I GOT CUT FROM THEIR FOOTBALL TEAM

RIGHT HERE WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT HOME
WITH NO FEAR OF MY LIFE SPENT ALL ALONE 
IT WAS CLEAR UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS 
THAT NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAID FROM OVER THERE 
THIS FIELD WAS OURS 
RIGHT HERE 

    
    SKIP
(sarcastic) Well that's touching.

WILL
Come on man, you used to love this stuff.

SKIP

Used to! I'd like to think I've changed a little since I left this place.

WILL
No, this place made us who we are! 

SKIP
YOU WISH
YOU'D NEVER CHANGE
AND YOU'D ALWAYS BE IN THAT SAME EPIC MOMENT

BUT YOU MOVED AWAY
AND YOU CAN PRAY THAT THEY'LL STAY
BUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS SAY GOODBYE
AND SORRY, YOU ARE DIFFERENT

WILL
NO! WE ARE STILL YOUNG
   
    Page 28

AND THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE TRIED TO RID OUR LIVES
 OF THE COOL PEOPLE'S BULLSHIT
 THE BRUISES TO PROVE THAT IT STUNG ARE STILL HERE
 CAUSE WE'RE STILL DIFFERENT
JACK
OH PLEASE, LET'S LET THIS BE
CUZ BOTH OF YOU ARE WRONG RIGHT NOW

WE ALL CHANGE AND AREN'T SURE HOW 
BUT I DON'T CARE WHAT IT TOOK TO GET ME TO HERE FROM THERE
I MAY BE DIFFERENT
BUT IM STILL ME I SWEAR

WILL
YOU ARE RIGHT, BUT SO AM I
WE CAN CHANGE, BUT CAN'T DENY
WE'LL ALWAYS BE THE GUYS WE WERE WHEN WE MET 

AND BACK WHEN YOU BEGAN IT
YOU DIDN'T PLAN IT 
BUT YOU CANT FORGET

RIGHT HERE WAS THE FIRST PLACE YOU FELT HOME
 WITH NO FEAR OF A LIFE SPENT ALL ALONE
 CUZ ITS CLEAR UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS, THAT

JACK and WILL

NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE FROM OVER THERE

WILL
THIS IS OURS

JACK, WILL and ANDY
RIGHT??

SKIP(WITH THE GUYS BEHIND HIM)
HERE WAS THE FIRST PLACE I FELT HOME

WITH NO FEAR OF MY LIFE SPENT ALL ALONE
CUZ ITS CLEAR UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS 

   ALL THE GUYS
 IT ONLY MATTERS WHAT YOU SEE
RIGHT HERE 
IS A BETTER PLACE THAN HOME
CUZ ITS CLEAR THAT WE'LL NEVER BE ALONE

AND THIS YEAR UNDER THESE ELECTRIC STARS
EVERYONE WILL SEE FROM OVER THERE
THAT WE ARE
RIGHT HERE
    
    Page 29
WILL
So... are we doing this or what? 


JACK
Yeah.

WILL
Skip?

SKIP
Fiiiiine....

ANDY

YEAH!! 

SKIP
But how are we getting into this box?

(Silence. ANDY, JACK, and SKIP look at WILL)

ANDY
Will?

WILL

(sigh) Fine.  I'll call her. 

(WILL takes out his phone and dials)

ANDY
That's my boy. Take one for the team!

WILL

I'm always taking one for the team. (into the phone) Hi, Patty? 

SKIP
I'm sorry... Patty?


ANDY
HAHA! FATTY PATTY!


(Throughout WILL's phone call ANDY does everything he can to distract him. Sexual sounds, etc.)

WILL
(glares at SKIP) It's Will! Hi. I'm fine. Listen, I'm calling because there seems to have been a bit of a mix up. The key that you gave me doesn't work. Yeah, nope.  So I was just wondering if there was any possibility - (beat) Oh, really!? No, that would be amazing! Thank you. (beat) Uh... Friday?
    

    Page 30
ANDY
(giving it to Friday and hard) Oh yeah, Friday!

WILL
Umm... I'm actually kinda busy then... (looking to the guys for help) 


ANDY
No you're not...

WILL
(looking to the guys for help) I just -I got in a car accident yesterday, so... I'm injured. Injured bad. 

(SKIP, ANDY and JACK begin laughing)

Yea I'll be okay, just broke a few bones. Sure. Yeah just give me a call back okay. Great! Thanks!


ANDY
What was that?

WILL
Cover. 

JACK 
What'd she say?


WILL 
She's babysitting right now, so she's going to look and see what she can find. She said she'd call me back.

SKIP
So we're just waiting?

WILL
I guess so.


ANDY
Dammit.

(Silence)

JACK
I feel like we should have brought a board game or something. 

ANDY
Like Jenga!?

    
    Page 31
WILL
Jenga's not a board game!

JACK
I was thinking more along the lines of like Monopoly.

ANDY

I hate Monopoly.

SKIP
You would.

ANDY
What is that supposed to mean?

SKIP
You're just not a Monopoly kinda guy. 


ANDY
Yea, cuz I hate it.

SKIP
No, I think it's more that you don't get it.

ANDY
Oh I get it.

SKIP

No....Monopoly requires a certain level of mathematical skill that I don't think you'va acquired. You know, adding and subtracting. The ability to understand numbers. It's hard.

ANDY
Jenga has that! You have to add and subtract blocks. (long beat) Okay, that was a stretch.

SKIP
Thank you for admitting it.

JACK

My roommate started a board game club in our dorm room this year. Didn't even ask.

ANDY
What a dick! What games?

JACK
Just one. Clue.

SKIP
Ohhh Lord. I can only imagine the people who wanted to join that club.

    
    Page 32
JACK
Actually there were only five kids who kept coming back, but Jesus Christ they were annoying. They called themselves "the Clue Crew."

ANDY
That's freakin weird dude. Your roommate sounds worse then Will.

WILL

Bite me

JACK
He was fine. I only had to put up with him for a little while.

WILL
Why? 

ANDY
Did he get kicked out?


JACK
No...

ANDY
Cause this kid on our floor got kicked out for smoking weed in his room. (to WILL) Remember Stevey?

WILL
Yeah?


ANDY
Smart kid too ... he tried to create this like ventilation system out his window so the RA couldn't smell it. But somebody saw the smoke outside and called the fire department. Now he goes to community college. Fuckin' sucks.

WILL
(to JACK) What happened to him?

    JACK
        Who?

    
    WILL
        Your roomate... The Clue Meister.

JACK
Nothing.

WILL
Then why did you only put up with him for a little while?

    
    Page 33
JACK
I didn't see him as much.

WILL
Why not?

JACK

Just cause.

SKIP
Wow, you're being awfully descriptive.

JACK
Well... (pause) I don't know. Ok. Actually I left before the semester ended. So....

SKIP

(beat) What? 

ANDY
Woah, woah, woah. Hold the phone... what did you do? 

JACK
I left.

ANDY

Just...left?

JACK
Yeah.

SKIP
Where did you go?

JACK
I took a road trip.


ANDY
GET OUT! 

SKIP
That's awesome! 

WILL
Why didn't you tell us?

JACK

I don't know. It wasn't a big deal.

ANDY
Are you shitting me?! That's huge!
    
    Page 34
SKIP
How long were you gone?


JACK
A little over a month... I got back like three weeks ago. 

SKIP
Wow, that's awesome! I'm jealous.

WILL
Wait...you've been home for three weeks? Why didn't you call us? (referencing ANDY too) We've been here.  


JACK
I know. 

WILL
I thought you were still at school. Did you not want us to know you were back?

JACK
No, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just needed some time alone.

ANDY

Well, I don't care, I wanna know everything! Where'd you go? What'd you do? Who'd ya bang? Tell me everything!

JACK
Everything?

ANDY
Yeah.

JACK
Okay...


THE OPEN ROAD

JACK
SO I TOOK A MONTH OFF FROM SCHOOL
AND DECIDED TO GO ON A TRIP
I PACKED MY BAGS AND KISSED MY MOM GOODBYE

ANDY
You kissed your Mom Dude? Gross...


JACK
AND I GOT INTO MY CAR
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF SHIT
BUT I DIDN'T CARE
I JUST NEEDED TO TRY

Page 35
AND GO DRIVING DOWN THE COAST
IN THE NICE DAYS OR THE RAIN

I WORE THE SAME CLOTHES AND GOT FOOD ON THE GO
I TORE AROUND THOSE CURVES
JUST SPEEDING THROUGH THE PLAINS
SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAST I WANTED TO EXPLODE
CAUSE IT WAS JUST ME
AND THE OPEN ROAD

I STOPPED AT ALL THE PARKS
AND SLEPT UNDER THE SKY

AND WHEN I WOKE I DROVE THE REST OF THE DAY
I TOOK SHORTCUTS THROUGH PEOPLES' YARDS
AND RAN MY GAS TANK CLOSE TO DRY
AND WHEN I SPED BY COPS I KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY
AFTER THE FOURTEENTH TIME
WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE EAST
WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN LOW
THERE WAS SO MUCH AIR THAT I COULD HARDLY BREATHE
I TAUGHT MYSELF THE LAND FROM THE BLUE RIDGE TO POCONOS

I BECAME AN EXPERT ON HOW TRAFFIC FLOWED
I LOVED MY LIFE ALONE
ON THE OPEN ROAD

AND THEN I MET THIS BOY AT A TRUCK STOP IN DES MOINES
HE WOULDN'T HITCH CAUSE HE HAD TOO MUCH PRIDE
SO I OFFERED HIM A RIDE

AND WE LEARNED EACH OTHER'S LAUGHS
AS WE TALKED ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT

AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THE TIME WAS RIGHT
HE KISSED ME IN THE CAR BENEATH A STARLESS SKY
AND WITH THAT KISS HE OPENED UP MY MIND
AND WE WENT DRIVING
WE WERE DRIVING
WE WERE DRIVING
JUST ME
A BEAUTIFUL BOY
AND THE OPEN ROAD


(Silence)

SKIP
Have you told your mom yet?

JACK
Yup.
    
    Page 36

SKIP
What'd she say?

JACK
She said she always knew -

SKIP
So did I.

JACK

- which was annoying.

SKIP
Oh. Sorry.

JACK
That's okay. 

SKIP
(pause) Well... that's huge man, I'm really proud of you!


(SKIP hugs JACK)
JACK
Thanks.

(SKIP stares at WILL) 

WILL
What? Oh. No, yeah that's awesome! I'm sorry... it's just... new. 


JACK
For me too.

WILL
It's great though!

ANDY
Yeah -

JACK

Thanks. (beat) Is this going to be okay?

SKIP
Of course.

JACK
I just don't want anything to change. You guys are my best friends and that's absolutely the last thing I want. 

WILL

It won't.
    
    Page 37
JACK
Okay. Good.

(silence)
    
SKIP

Well I don't know about you fellas, but I think this calls for a celebration! Everybody ready to get drunk?

    
    
    ANDY
        Fuck yeah!


    JACK
        Absolutely.

    
    

SKIP
Great! Who's coming with me to the car?

WILL
You already got it?

SKIP
Of course. Always a step ahead, amigo! 

JACK

I'll help.

SKIP
Sweet. (to WILL and ANDY) Back in a flash! 

(SKIP and JACK exit. Long silence)

WILL

    (to ANDY) Wow. (beat) Well... I wasn't expecting that.

(Silence. ANDY is sitting on the player's bench staring at his phone)

Andy?

ANDY

Yeah?

WILL
You all right?

ANDY
Mhmm.

WILL
You sure?


Page 38
ANDY
Yeah.

WILL
What's wrong?

ANDY
Nothing.


WILL
Please. I know you.

ANDY
(biting) Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

WILL
You don't look fine.


ANDY
Well... (beat) are you?

WILL
Yeah.

ANDY
Really?


WILL
(unconvinced) Yeah. I mean... of course I am...yeah.

ANDY
It doesn't bother you?

WILL
No... It bothers you?


ANDY
(boiling) Yeah... it does.

WILL
Are you serious?

THINGS ARE DIFFERENT

ANDY

DON'T LOOK AT ME THAT WAY
I'M NOT CRAZY
THIS IS MY LIFE TOO
AND IT IS NOT A GAME
IF IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU

Page 39
THAT HE'S CHANGING, FINE
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT HIM

IT DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME
JACK IS GONE TO ME
I JUST WATCHED HIM DISAPPEAR
IT MAY BE WRONG TO LEAVE
BUT I DON'T WANT HIM HERE

WILL
Don't...

ANDY

WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

WILL
JUST DON'T GO
I KNOW IT'S NEW 
BUT WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO LEAVE JUST CUZ HE'S OPENED UP
HE'S OUR BEST FRIEND, DON'T WE ASK THAT OF HIM?
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, IT'LL JUST TAKE SOME MORE
TO WORK IN OUR OLD WAY

OKAY?

ANDY
NO
I WON'T SAY I DON'T CARE
I LOOK AND MY FRIEND ISNT THERE
I DON'T LIKE BEING LIED TO

WILL
OH, AND I DO?


ANDY
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
YOU ALWAYS SEE THE UPSIDE
WHY?

WILL
CAUSE I CAN STILL SEE HIM WHEN I LOOK AT HIS FACE
HE'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT, HE'S JUST IN A DIFFERENT PLACE
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY

CAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE
WHY GREET THAT CHANGE BY CAUSING HIM PAIN?

ANDY
I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM

WILL
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT YOU WILL?

Page 40

ANDY
LOOK, THIS ISNT MY BURDEN

WILL
YOU'RE HIS FRIEND




    WILL
        YOU SHOULD TRY UNTIL YOU
             UNDERSTAND HIM

    ANDY
        MAYBE HE SHOULD
            UNDERSTAND ME
    
    
    
    WILL
        THIS ISNT WRONG, ANDY THIS IS JUST NEW
            YOU CANT WRITE OFF JACK CAUSE HE'S DIFFERENT THAN YOU
    
    
    
    
    ANDY
        DONT MAKE IT SOUND 
             LIKE I'M WRONG
            I WISH THINGS COULD STAY 
            THE WAY THEY WERE ALL
            ALONG, BUT...

    
    
    WILL
        YOU'RE NOT
            WRONG, BUT...
 
    
    

    ANDY
        THINGS ARE DIFFERENT, WILL
            THINGS HAVE CHANGED
            JACK IS NO LONGER WITH US
            ONLY THE SURFACE REMAINS
            NOW ITS JUST YOU AND ME 
            AND SKIP.  WE'LL WORK AS THREE

    
    
    WILL
        THIS ISN'T WRONG ANDY, THIS IS JUST NEW
            HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT YOU CANT LOVE HIM
            JACK NEVER SAID THAT YOU HAD TO LIVE
            YOUR LIFE ONE WAY
            LET GO OF YOUR BIAS, HE IS YOUR FRIEND 
            OR THIS COULD BE

    
    
WILL AND ANDY
NOT FOUR ANYMORE


    WILL
        Andy -
        
ANDY
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME TO DO?

WILL
LET IT GO


ANDY
IS THIS FOR HIM OR FOR YOU?

WILL
JUST LET IT GO

ANDY
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING THIS ON ME 

WILL

LOOK, IM NOT SAYING I DISAGREE
BUT PLEASE, FOR ME, KEEP QUIET

Page 41
ANDY
Fine.

WILL
Fine.


(ANDY walks up the bleachers, while WILL walks down the field. JACK and SKIP enter carrying two cases of Natty Light)

SKIP
The pride parade is back!

(JACK and SKIP set the cases on the player's bench.)

WILL
What did you get?

SKIP

Only the best for my boys! Natty Light!

(SKIP tosses a can of Natty Light to WILL)

WILL
(sarcastic) Mmm... Did you steal these from your Dad's fridge?

SKIP
Nope! (proudly) Bought em.


WILL
How?

SKIP
THIS guy!

(SKIP flashes a fake ID)

WILL
Let me see that.


(SKIP hands the ID to WILL)
SKIP
(recites the info from memory) Julio Mendez. 5225 Ridgemont Court. Ironwood, Minnesota.   September 7th, 1983.

Page 42
JACK
Impressive.


SKIP
I know.

WILL
This looks nothing like you.

SKIP
Sure it does!

WILL

No it doesn't. This kid is Hispanic. 

SKIP
Well it worked didn't it?

(SKIP takes his ID away from WILL)

JACK
(grabbing a beer) You know, I didn't have a single drop of alcohol this past year, and guess what, I'm still sane.


SKIP
Yeah but you're gay. See what sobriety can do to you? 

    (Awkward silence. Musical break.) 
    
    WILL
(WILL, covering, takes a sip.) This stuff is terrible!


SKIP
Then don't drink it.
    
    Page 43
WILL
Just saying, I thought you had better taste then this.

SKIP

Listen, I had ten dollars.  For ten dollars, this is quality.

WILL
Touché.
    
    (Awkward silence. Musical Break.) 
    
JACK

(to WILL) Did what's her face call?

WILL
Nope.

SKIP
How long are we gonna to wait around for this girl?

WILL

I don't know. You got places to be?

SKIP
No, I just don't wanna be out here all night! That's all!

ANDY
Amen to that.

(Awkward silence. Musical Break.) 


WILL
(to JACK, about SKIP) So what do you think of this new look?

JACK
I wasn't gonna say anything but, you kinda look like a pothead. 

WILL
I think he looks like a woman. 


(WILL and JACK laugh at this)

SKIP
You know what? I don't really care if it looks good or not. 

WILL
You should.

SKIP
Why? Who am I trying to impress?


Page 44
ANDY
Not us, apparently. 

JACK
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised. I thought you were gonna come back looking like a total Ivy Leauge prep. You know, pink polo with the popped collar...
    

    SKIP
    Never! My roommate was like that. He wore plaid shorts every day of the week. It'd be 15 degrees outside and he'd still be wearing plaid shorts and boat shoes. Dumbass.

        WILL
Sounds like your kind of guy.
  
SKIP
Not to mention the fact that his dad bought him a Lexus when he graduated from high school.

   
WILL
Jesus.
       
JACK
 I got a check from my grandma that bounced.
    
SKIP

Yeah. And he was all pissed off cause it wasn't a Beamer. 
    
JACK
Shut up!
    
WILL
So what did you say?
    

SKIP
About what?
    
       WILL
 To him - about the car.
    
       SKIP

 Nothing.
    
 WILL
Why not?
    
 SKIP
What was I supposed to say?

    
WILL
I dunno, a guy like that - I figured you'd let him have it.

Page 45
SKIP
Why would I "let him have it?" Nothing I'm gonna say is going to change anything, so why waste the energy?

JACK
 ...When you can just grow your hair out.

    
SKIP
Exactly!
    
WILL
 Are you kidding me?! 
    
SKIP

 What?
    
 WILL
I've just never heard of you backing down from an opportunity like that. You're the most opinionated guy I know.
     
SKIP
    My opinion doesn't mean shit Will! It's just one opinion. So why not go with the flow? I mean I'm doing your prank, aren't I?

         
WILL
    It's not my prank! It's OUR prank!
    
    SKIP
        Right. I forgot. Sorry. My point is who cares.
    

    WILL
        What does that mean, who cares? 
    
    SKIP
        I mean no one really listens to anyone anyway, they're all too wrapped up in themselves. So why should I be any different?
    

    WILL
        Because you are. You always have been. It's why we're friends.
    
SKIP
I thought we were friends because we sucked at football.
    
WILL
You know what I mean. 

    
SKIP
Yea, I do. But as much as I know you believe you are, you're not different. You're standing here, talking about how things should change. And not doing shit. Just like everybody else.

GENERATION APATHY

TO THE GENERATION THAT'LL TURN THIS NATION 
FROM A SUPERPOWER INTO A GHOST 

OUR FATHERS ARE COMMUTERS, BUT WE'RE STUCK IN OUR COMPUTERS 
 WHICH TAKE US ALL AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER, BUT WHO CARES

CUZ WE'RE TOO OCCUPIED TO NOTICE WHAT WAS THERE HAS DIED 
BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WHO USED TO LOVE EACH OTHER, CUZ WHO CARES

(WILL pulls his phone out of his pocket and walk aways)

SKIP
(to WILL) Where are you going?


WILL
(agitated) Calling Patricia.

SKIP
Are you mad at me?

WILL
No, I just wanna know where she is. 


(WILL walks down the field, away from the guys and starts to call Patricia.)

SKIP
(to JACK and ANDY) Wow, he's being moody tonight.

(WILL closes his phone and puts it back in his pocket)

AFTER ALL


WILL
WHEN I FEEL ALONE, I HAVE THESE FRIENDS OF MINE
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME, WHO KEEP ME SANE IN TROUBLED TIMES
AND WHEN I LOSE MY WAY, I HAVE THEM THERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND
AND THEN I DON'T FEEL LONELY AFTER ALL

WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I ONLY HAD MYSELF
TO GUIDE MY LIFELESS ACTION FIGURES TO THE FLOOR, DOWN FROM THE SHELF
MY BEDROOM WAS MY PLAYGROUND TO DRAW AND WRITE AND PRAY

THAT I WOULD FIND SOME REAL FRIENDS TO GUIDE ME SOMEDAY
AND NOW

THEY'VE ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS ON ALL THE THINGS WE SAID WE LOVED
CAUSE EVERYONE'S DECIDED THAT THIS ISNT WHAT IT WAS
WELL NOBODY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT WE'RE ALLOWED TO CHANGE
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IM THE ONE WHO'S STILL THE SAME
AND NOW

I AM STILL ALONE WITH ALL THESE FRIENDS OF MINE
THE OTHER HALVES OF ME WHO RAN AWAY IN TROUBLED TIMES
AND NOW I FEEL THE SHAME OF HOLDING ONTO WHAT'S NO LONGER MINE

MAYBE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT AFTER ALL

(SKIP notices WILL's notebook under the bench)

SKIP
What's that? 

JACK
What? 


(SKIP picks up the notebook)

SKIP
(reads) "The Personal Memoirs of William Frances Levinson." Ooooh nooo... 

JACK
Frances!!

ANDY
What are you doing? 

(WILL runs over)

WILL
Don't!

SKIP
What?

WILL
Please don't read that.

SKIP
Why?

WILL

Cause it's not yours.

No.

Look, could you not. It's private- 

SKIP
Private? Like...a diary?

WILL

It's not a diary!

SKIP
    Well then you won't mind if I read it.  (reading) "I stared in awe at a row of glistening bottles on the top shelf, with names like Southern Comfort, Bristol Cream, and Wild Turkey. I chose the Comfort, and the boys dared me to take the first sip. " (to WILL) What is this? 


WILL
It's nothing, okay? 

SKIP
Is this about us? 

Page 50
WILL
Maybe. (beat) Yeah.


SKIP
(flipping through the pages) There's a lot here. 

WILL
(embarrassed) Yea. I know. 

SKIP

When did you write all this?

WILL
At school.

ANDY
Is that why you were in the room so much? I always thought you were, you know...
    
    WILL

Well...that too.

JACK
Let me see! 

(SKIP hands the notebook to JACK)

JACK
(reading) "Chapter One. Football Tryouts."


SKIP
You wrote about tryouts!? 

JACK
(reading) "There was no real reason why we should have become friends. What tied us together was the fact that we were uncommon."

(Lighting shift w/ underscoring. This moment should be treated as an almost out of body experience.)

(reading) "Jack Moyer was incredibly small for his age and was constantly teased about it. During the first week of school, he had been targeted by a group of seniors who periodically stuffed him in one of the trashcans on the 2nd floor. By the time he'd get to eighth period he was covered in pencil shavings and smelled like chocolate milk." 

    
    Page 51
    SKIP
(reading) "Skip Thomas was a military brat who had lived in 5 different countries before the age of 14. His father was a high-ranking officer in the United States Army. He expected his children to call him sir and he called them men, before they even knew how to shave."

JACK
(reading) "When I first met Jack, he was wearing baggy sweatpants and a jersey that was almost twice his size, in what could only be construed as an attempt to compensate for his lack of... muscle mass?!"


SKIP
(reading) "At tryouts, Skip marched out from the locker room, complete with a GI Joe style crew cut, stopping only to stand at attention whenever a coach passed by."

ANDY
(reading) "Andy Scott lived on the corner of Woodmont and Great Oak Road with his three older brothers and younger sister."

SKIP

HOT sister!

(ANDY punches SKIP in the arm and continues to read)

ANDY
"His father was a star quarterback for the OSU Buckeyes and his brothers had all played varsity football for the Beavers..."

JACK
(reading) "All I could think was that Jack bore a striking resemblance to ... Popeye??" What? "Without the pads he was a scrawny little runt, but when he put them on he instantly looked like he'd eaten his spinach."


SKIP
(reading) "Oh, and lest I forget the most important detail - Skip wasn't his real name either. We quickly called him that after he was introduced to us as..." 

ANDY
Say it.

SKIP

No.

JACK
Come on, say it. Be proud.

SKIP
(embarrassed, unintelligible) Hopper....

ANDY

I'm sorry. What was that? 
    
    Page 52
SKIP
(a little louder) Hopper...

ANDY
One more time.


SKIP
(biting) Hopper!! Hopper Fucking Thomas!! Like a stupid little bunny!!!

ANDY 
OHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

JACK
Yeah, your parents really weren't thinking long term with that one.


(JACK and ANDY are both laughing at this)

SKIP
Screw you guys. I was named after my grandfather.

JACK
Your grandfather's name was Hopper? 

SKIP
Norman Hopper.


JACK
Why didn't they just name you Norman?

SKIP
I don't know. I wasn't there! Shut up!

ANDY
(reading) "Andy seemed destined for athletic glory. Except for one minor problem. He was a terrible athlete. He failed at every sport he tried and his father and brothers never let him forget it. In an attempt to win their respect, Andy tried out for the JV football squad. But on the first day of tryouts Andy managed to run the ball into the wrong end zone. Twice."


(Everyone except ANDY laughs at this)

ANDY
Whatever man! At least I touched the ball. You guys didn't even make it past wind sprints. (reading) "The seniors called him Conan, but I don't think Andy ever really understood why." (to WILL) What!? Yeah I did! It was cause I was strong as shit!

SKIP

More like dumb as shit.

ANDY
    Screw you! (reading) "When we left the field that day becoming friends seemed like a last resort.  
    
    Page 53
    But it actually resulted in an unexpected brotherhood. We knew we were different and as we spent more and more time together, we began to loath the idea of being 'normal.' We'd never be homecoming kings or football stars but in the grand scheme of things, that didn't matter. Our friendship was defined by who we were, by our standards. Life pushes you in a direction whether you choose it or not. Oddly enough, life turned us around so we could find each other."


(Silence)
JACK
Wow Will, that's really good.

WILL
Thanks.

(ANDY slams the notebook shut)

ANDY

Well I hate it!

SKIP
Come on Andy! We never would have become friends if you'd run those touchdowns into the right end zone. (beat) Either time.

(The guys laugh)

ANDY
True, but it's a story, can't you change it a little? Artistic likeness?


WILL
License?

ANDY
Yeah all that. Besides where's all the shit about you?

WILL
What are you talking about?

ANDY

Why isn't there anything in here about you being a fatty.

WILL
I was not.

ANDY
    Uh yes you were. You were a fucking tub! You were so fat your belly came out from under your jersey. You and Fat Pat would've been perfect together -

(SKIP laughs hard)
    

    Page 54
WILL
Whatever man, that was baby fat!

ANDY
Dude that was not baby fat. That was fat fat. You came to school with like twenty Snack Packs a day. You looked like Chunk from The Goonies!

(They all laugh)


WILL
You guys suck!

(The boys collapse and sprawl out on the grass.)


WILL
How many kids do you think have graduated from this place?

JACK
So many.

SKIP
That's not a number, Jack.

WILL

(WILL sits up) Seriously though, how many kids have filed in and out of this building over the years, like it was a goddamn assembly line. Think about all those kids that graduated in our class that we never even knew. Like, remember that skinny kid with the thick glasses who always farted in gym?

JACK
Fahid?

WILL
Yeah him!  He'll always be that kid you never wanted to follow during the rope climb. And that's probably all we'll ever know him as.

ANDY

He also borrowed my pen during Calculus and never gave it back. I'll never forget that. 
    
    59
    WILL
(Will stands up and runs to the bleachers) I mean, how many kids do you think have sat out on these bleachers over the years? How many?(Will runs over to the bleachers and stands on the first row of seats) Who sat here? Huh? (Will runs back to the third row and stands) Who sat here? (The guys laugh. But WILL is driven.) No really! (beat) Think about how many people have made out right where you're sitting! (Points to where Andy is sitting)


ANDY
(reads some writing on the bleachers) Apparently "Chris and Amanda." 

WILL
See, like that! Who are they? Where are they now? We could probably never figure out who they are. We'd have to go through every single yearbook...and even then there are probably thousands of Chris' and Amanda's. 

    JACK
True.


WILL
Think about all the stuff that has happened out here. And we're part of it. Cuz we're really here.

SKIP
You're insane.

WILL
No, I just have a vivid imagination. 

JACK

Hey, do you guys remember when Will told us he was 16 when he wasn't?

(Everyone explodes laughing, except for WILL of course)

SKIP
I haven't thought about that in so long. 

ANDY
Yea, why did you lie about that? You knew we were gonna find out when we got our drivers' licenses.

JACK

You had me for a while though, I totally bought the "my mom wants me to wait until she thinks I'm ready."

SKIP
Cuz your mom would so do that. That bitch is crazy.

ANDY
Crazy hot! 
        
        Page 60

    
SKIP
Gentlemen, Andy Scott, case in point.
   
ANDY
Glad to be here, glad to be here.

JACK
I remember the day we caught you too. We were at Andy's house and your mom was like... (laughs) "It's gonna be so nice of you boys to drive Willy around until he TURNS 16." WHAAAAAAAAAT? 


(Everyone laughs)

WILL
Listen jerks! Everything was going great, I didn't want the fact that we were different ages to mess anything up.

SKIP
You're OCD. 

ANDY
It doesn't matter if our ages are symmetrical.


SKIP
Do you mean identical?

ANDY
No, I meant what I said.

JACK
You should be proud. You skipped Kindergarten! That means you're smarter than us.


SKIP
Yeah, who skips Kindergarten? Of all grades. "Oh, young William? He plays with blocks better than the other kids. Bump him!"

(They all laugh. WILL's phone rings, Goofy ring.)
             
SKIP
Is that really your ring?

WILL

What?

SKIP
Yikes man. 

WILL
Screw you. (answers the phone) Hello!? Faa - Paa - Patty? Hey! Hi. So did you... Really!? (disappointed) Oh.

        
        Page 61
ANDY
What? 

WILL
(into the phone) Don't worry about it. No no it's okay. 


ANDY
What did she say?

WILL
We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Thanks anyway. (beat)  Umm... yeah I'm actually busy Thursday night too so.... Uh-huh. Yeah that's a bad night too. Remember- broken bones. I got broken bones. Okay well gotta run, but I'll talk to you later. Okay. Great! Bye. (hangs up the phone) Jesus.

JACK

(to WILL) What's wrong?

WILL
That girl does not give up.

ANDY
No, what's up with the key!?

WILL

Well... she says it's in the building.  

ANDY
What!?

WILL
Apparently it may be in the maintenance closet. 

JACK
So what did she give us?


WILL
She doesn't know, but now she's pretty sure it's in there. 

ANDY
(sarcastic) Well that's great, we probably have his car keys. What are we supposed to do now?

SKIP
(beat) You know... we could always try and sneak into the building?


ANDY
Keep talking!

WILL
How?

JACK
How?
        

        Page 62
    
SKIP
Well... there's that window in the gym. The one we used to sneak out of during assemblies. We could definitely get in through there. And if the closet's locked, screw it, let's just break in.

JACK
They're going to set off some alarm in that building and we're all gonna get caught.

WILL
No they wont! Jack, bad vibes!

JACK
Okay fine. Good vibes, good vibes. But you know I'm right.

WILL

Probably.

(Long silence) 

    So... is there a guy? Like a guy, like a boyfriend guy? Is that what you call it?

JACK
Sure. You can call it that. 


WILL
Sorry. (beat) So is there?

JACK
No. There isn't. 

WILL
What about... what's his face?


JACK
Who?

WILL
    The guy you met. You know, the one that you... (starts making weird gestures with his hands... he's not sure how to say it)

JACK
Kissed?


WILL
Yeah. Do you still talk to him? 

JACK
Not really. No.

WILL
Why not?

JACK

I dunno. He lives in Iowa. I live here. It's not like I'm gonna start doing long distance. (beat) We're friends on Myspace, that's something, right?
        
        Page 64
WILL
(laughs) I guess. (beat) So, can I ask you a question?


JACK
You just did. Something else? 

WILL
Yea. How long have you known? 

JACK
About what? 

WILL

You know. I mean, was it something that you always knew or...

JACK
(wryly) Why so curious?
 
WILL
I dunno, I just - I've never gotten to ask anyone stuff like this before. And I just wanna know what it's like. I mean, what you're going through.

JACK

    Well... I think part of me has always known... And I kind of just pushed it away. I'd think this isn't right. This isn't normal. And it stayed that way for a while. I just kept telling myself - I'll grow out of it. Eventually I'll meet some girl and everything will change. But it never did. So... (beat) it wasn't like a sudden realization or anything.

(WILL nods, beat)

    Does that bother you?

WILL
No, of course not. 


JACK
Cool. (beat) What do you think Andy thinks?

WILL
(caught off guard) I don't know... I'm not...

JACK

I'm just curious. I didn't know if he said anything to you when we left before.

WILL
What would he have said?

JACK
I don't know. But he hasn't really said anything to me since -I just don't think he's thrilled.
        
        Page 65

    
WILL
Andy's weird. "What do you think Andy thinks?" is kind of a loaded question?

JACK
Yea. But I can tell when something's bothering him.

WILL
(beat) Well, I mean...okay. Okay, he did say something.


JACK
He did?? Why didn't you tell me?

WILL
Cuz he asked me not to. He didn't want to ruin the night. But I'd feel like a bad friend not telling you.

JACK
What'd he say?

WILL

He just said he's not really all that cool with it, and you should have told us a while ago if you...were. Like you've been lying to us or blah blah blah. I dunno, it was pretty much bullshit.

JACK
He said that?

WILL
...Yeah.

JACK
Should I talk to him?


WILL
NO! I mean it'd be better if you didn't, cause I told him I wouldn't tell you. So... I'm sorry... should I not have?

JACK
No you did the right thing. I just don't understand why he'd think that? Why would I try to screw things up? 

WILL
It's not you, Jack. It's him.

What?

JACK

That you couldn't deal with it. That you've been sitting here all night not saying anything. Why not, why don't you just talk to me?

(to WILL) Why would you tell him that....

JACK
He was being a good friend, Andy. I think I have the right to know that.

ANDY

(to WILL) I don't believe you. 

SKIP
Why is this bothering you so much?

JACK 
I didn't tell you earlier, because I wasn't ready yet, Andy-

Look, do whatever you want. I'm going.

Why? What the fuck is your deal right now?

CUZ IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE


BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU?
I MEAN, OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
CUZ IF YOU DID, YOU'D SEE
THAT YOU JUST WENT TOO FAR
    
    73
    CUZ WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE

WHAT WE MAKE A PERSON FEEL
SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE
WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL

(ANDY starts to walk away)

SO BEFORE YOU GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
DO NOT ACCEPT 
WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT TO A FRIEND

SO, AS ONE OF THEM
WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS...

ANDY
(overlapping)
...LOOK WHO'S "SPEAKING OUT"
LIKE HE KNOWS ABOUT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
JUST PUT THE BLAME ON ME
THEN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT

        
        
        
        
    JACK
        YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE
            WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL
            SO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU LOSE
             WHEN THE PAIN YOU INFLICT BECOMES REAL
            
            SO BEFORE I GO, YOU SHOULD KNOW
            THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
            DONT FUCK WITH OTHER
UNLESS THEY WANT TO LOSE EACH OTHER
WELL, YOU JUST LOST ME

    
    
    ANDY
        YOU DON'T CARE HOW I FEEL
            SO WHY SHOULD I CARE WHAT I SAY TO YOU?
    
            NO, I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
            THAT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
            DON'T FUCK WITH EACH OTHER
 
        
        
(Silence.)
    
JACK
And now you have nothing to say? (beat) Kay. I'll go.


WILL
Jack- 

JACK
No. It's okay.

(JACK exits)

        74

    
SKIP
Why would you say that to him?

ANDY
I wasn't calling him that!

SKIP
He's supposed to be one of your best friends and you treat him like he wronged you. He did nothing to you.

ANDY

Skip -

SKIP
You just fucked up a friendship for all of us because you're too selfish to get that it's not always about YOU!

ANDY
Can I please say something?

SKIP
No! Everything that's coming out of your mouth tonight is toxic, and I'm tired of listening to it.


        ANDY
  I would never call him -
        
WILL
Andy, stop -

ANDY
No! (to SKIP) It's not about him being gay, Skip, it's about -


SKIP
I don't wanna hear it! No one does -

ANDY
Skip -

MY TURN
        
        WILL

ANDY... THE THING IS
    THAT ANDY...

ANDY
IS HE'S THE ONE TALKING
SO SHUT THE FUCK UP
WHY ANDY?
IT'S ALL ABOUT "ANDY"
BUT NOBODY LETS ME SPEAK!


    Page 75
WHEN I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIT IN 
    AND BE LIKE YOU WANT ME TO BE
    TRYING TO BE LIKE YOU
    BUT I GUESS YOU CANT CHANGE...

SKIP

    I DONT REALLY CARE WHEN YOU ARE THAT UNFAIR TO...

        WILL
  ANDY, PLEASE CALM DOWN, THERE'S...
        
SKIP and WILL
OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.....


ANDY
THAT INCLUDES ME TOO, YOU GUYS
YOU CANT JUST ERASE ME
IM SORRY THAT FIGHT HAD TO CHANGE YOUR NIGHT
BUT THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS FACE ME
    
    YOU CAN'T KEEP LYING TO YOURSELF
        AND HOPE YOU'LL FORGET IT

        LYING TO KEEP US CLOSE
        BUT IT WENT TO SHIT CAUSE YOU LET IT
    
    WILL
    Listen -
    
        ANDY

    NO! IT IS MY TURN TO LET ME TALK
    IF YOU DON'T
    I'LL TAKE MY TURN TO TELL THE TRUTH
    IF YOU WON'T
    IM NOT SAYING JACK WAS WRONG, OR IM THE ONE WHO'S RIGHT
    BUT IT IS MY TURN TO SAY MY PIECE TONIGHT

    
    THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WILL
        LOOK AROUND
        YOUR GOOD OLD GLORY DAYS
        ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
    
    (ANDY picks up the notebook up off the bleachers)

    
    AND ALL OF THESE MEMORIES WE USED TO ENJOY
        THE NIGHTS OUT HERE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE
        THE BROTHERS THAT NO ONE COULD EVER DESTROY
        WERE WORTH NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING!!

    (ANDY tears the notebook apart.)


        76
    
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOYS?
NOW IT IS MY TURN TO ASK YOU 
    WHAT TO DO?
    
    WHEN AFTER FIVE YEARS

    I DON'T TRUCT YOU
    WE'VE BEEN BROTHERS FOR SO LONG
    AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE - 

SO IT IS MY TURN -

IT IS MY TURN
    TO GO

    BUT IT IS YOUR TURN
    TO KNOW 
    I'VE NEVER HAD A GIFT LIKE YOURS FOR CLEVER WORDS TO SAY
    BUT NOW IT'S MY TURN AND I DONT WANT THEM ANYWAY
    
    (ANDY exits.)


SKIP
Andy -
    
(WILL, near tears, is on the ground, trying to piece together his journal)

PAGE 77
What was he talking about? You lied to him?

WILL

No. (beat)  I lied to him. And Jack. And you.

SKIP
About what?

WILL
Andy told me he wasn't cool with Jack coming out and I told him not to saying anything, cause I didn't want anything to get fucked up. But I fucked it up anyway. (beat) This is all my fault.


SKIP
Oh calm down. The world's not ending. They'll cool off. Maybe they'll even make out, everyone else is doing it. (beat) Why were you guys kissing anyways?  Something you wanna tell me?

WILL
No. I dunno. He kissed me. I just - let it happen.


SKIP
You can't go around trying to please everyone Will.

WILL
I know.

(WILL continues to pick up the pieces of the notebook)

SKIP
(beat) It's just a diary. You can always get another one.


(SKIP kneels down to help)

WILL
(smiles) It's not a diary. (beat) Skip...everything I've ever felt was in this thing. 

SKIP

Well, that's not healthy.

WILL
Yeah, maybe not. 

SKIP
Maybe not. (holding the papers in his hand) This stuff was from when we were kids, Will. We've grown up a little since then.

WILL

I know, but when the hell did that happen?
  
  Page 78
SKIP
Good question.

BOYS

WILL

WHEN WE WERE BOYS
WE HAD FUN
AND BLAMED MISTAKES ON BEING HUMAN

BUT NOW WE'RE OLD
AND EVEN ONE
WITH GOOD INTENT HAS POWER TO RUIN

YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO BE A MAN
BUT THIS IS A PART OF IT THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND


ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID
ARE FILLED WITH THE THINGS THAT ALL OF US DID
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER WE WERE SO SURE
THAT WE'D NEVER STOP BEING BOYS ANYMORE

SKIP
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU THINK IS DEAD
YOU'RE WHINING LIKE YOUR LIFE IS OVER


WILL
IT FEELS THAT WAY

SKIP
BUT NO ONE SAID
YOU CANT SCREW UP WHEN YOU GET OLDER

WILL
WE WERE SO PERFECT TIL TODAY


SKIP
BUT ANDY'S RIGHT
THE GOOD OLD DAYS

WILL and SKIP
NEVER STAY

ALL OF MY MEMORIES FROM BEING A KID
MAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY WHAT WE DID
WE AREN'T WORKING LIKE BEFORE

BUT DOES THAT MEAN WE CANT BE BOYS ANYMORE?

WILL
I DON'T LIKE THIS FEELING
  
  Page 79
THAT I COULD BE LOSING YOU

SKIP

NOBODY IS LOSING
EVERYONE'S JUST GROWING TOO

WILL
WHAT IF THIS WAS NEVER RIGHT
AND IT TOOK US UP UNTIL TONIGHT 
TO REALIZE WE'D BEEN SAVING FACE
AND ADMIT WE ARE OUT OF PLACE

SKIP

    DON'T FIGHT TO FIGURE OUT
        SOMETHING WE'LL ALL JUST LAUGH ABOUT
ONE DAY

WILL and SKIP
ONE DAY

WILL
I AM NOT READY TO STOP BEING A KID


SKIP
WELL NOBODY SAID THAT WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED

WILL and SKIP
WE'LL NEVER BE WHO WE WERE BEFORE

SKIP
BUT NEVER SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BOYS...

WILL and SKIP

(tradeoff)
ANYMORE
ANYMORE
ANYMORE

(A long silence)

SKIP
God I hate this place. Why couldn't we have gone to Andy's and watched Ella Enchanted? (beat) I'm gonna go.  You want a ride?


WILL
No, that's okay.

SKIP
You sure?
  
  Page 80
WILL

Yeah...I think I'm gonna stay out here a little longer.

SKIP
All right. We're gonna be okay. I promise.

(SKIP starts to exit.)

Oh I almost forgot.

(SKIP pulls a key out of his pocket and tosses it to WILL)


WILL
You found it.

SKIP
Yeah, the closet was unlocked. So... you went on that date for no reason. Just saying. 

WILL
(smiles) Thanks.


(Silence)

SKIP
(beat) Hey. I love you, ok?

WILL
I know. I love you too.

SKIP

(beat) Night buddy.

WILL 
    Night man.

(SKIP exits.)

MY NEXT STORY


LOOK AT THIS FIELD
LOOK AT THIS PERFECT FIELD
WHAT REALLY KEEPS PEOPLE HERE?
THESE WHITE LINES?
NO BOUNDARIES TO HOLD US HERE
EXCEPT FOR MINE

IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY 

INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IVE BEGUN BUT CANT SEEM TO COMPLETE
CEPT THIS IS ALL I KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO
  
  Page 81
OR WHAT ELSE THERE IS TO ME
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN MY NEXT STORY

THEY SAY TO WRITE THE THINGS YOU KNOW
WELL THAT I HAVE, AND THERE THEY BLOW

AROUND THIS FIELD, NO WAY TO SEW 
THEM BACK TOGETHER

I WANT TO SAY IM SORRY FOR
MY INDISCRETIONS FROM BEFORE
BUT NO ONE'S HERE TO HEAR ANYMORE
AND BRING US BACK TOGETHER

I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT

WHEN SHIFTING STARTED TO OCCUR 
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET IT 
MAKE US WHO WE ARE FROM WHO WE WERE 

BUT THERE REALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING GOOD IF I COULD WRITE A STORY
 WITH NO CONVERSIONS OF VERSIONS OF MYSELF I HATE TO BE
 AND THIS DRAFT THAT I  DO WOULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE
 WHICH SEEMS QUITE OVERDUE FOR ME

 BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I SEE MY NEXT STORY

LETS SEE
IM MAKING MISTAKES
BUT EACH ONE TAKES ME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION
IM GETTING LOST
BUT FINDING OUT THE COST OF PUSHING TOO HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION

WHEN AM I GROWN UP AND WHEN AM I STILL IMMATURE?

WILL I EVER BE MORE THAN JUST UNSURE?
AND WHEN AM I MAN?
AND WHEN I AM WILL I STILL JUST BE DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN

WHEN I WAS THE GLUE THAT HELD US TOGETHER
OBSERVOR, INVENTOR, AND SOLE DOCUMENTOR
CONSTANTLY WATCHING, THE CONSTANT INCENTIVE 
TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD, AND ALWAYS...
REMEMBER...

ALWAYS REMEMBER...
KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND ALWAYS REMEMBER...

(throws the key into the distance)

I DON'T KNOW HOW BUT STARTING NOW I VOW TO TELL A STORY
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF LIFE I'VE YET TO SEE
BUT STILL CAN FIND A WAY TO SAY "THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I AM TODAY"
AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE
RIGHT HERE IN MY STORY

    AND I'LL TELL IT TRUTHFULLY    
    
    Page 82
    CAUSE IT'S JUST ME
AND MY NEXT STORY

(The sprinkler system goes off, soaking WILL.)

THE END.
